The Bataan oil spill has affected the livelihood of fisherfolk in Manila Bay, specifically in Bataan and Cavite. Hectares of critical ecosystems were said to be potentially affected, too.
Representatives from the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources, Department of Environment and Natural Resources, Philippine Coast Guard (PCG), and the Maritime Industry Authority told Villar they would immediately work on filing cases, with varying targets from one to three months.
But the Department of Justice (DOJ) would have to ensure the strength of evidence, said Fretti Ganchoon, senior state counsel at the DOJ. Ganchoon specializes on international maritime law. 
“So, ibig mong sabihin, walang strength of evidence? Nakita mo na ‘yung oil spill, nakita mo na ‘yung di nakain ‘yung isda for ilang weeks, tapos ngayon, strength of evidence pa sasabihin mo sa akin?” Villar, who leads the Senate committee on environment, natural resources and climate change, said on Tuesday. This is the Senate’s second hearing into the oil spill incident that happened last July. 
(Do you mean to tell me there’s no strength of evidence when you already saw the oil spill, you saw how the fish were uneatable for weeks? Now, you’re using strength of evidence as an excuse?)
Ganchoon explained that the case buildup is a crucial part of filing, as insufficient evidence will only result in a dismissal of the case. She added that damage to livelihood and the environment can either be a civil or criminal case.
“Very technical po kasi ‘yung evidence in court,” Ganchoon said. “But dito po sa atin, we can say na, opo, may effect sa environment.“
(Evidence in court is very technical. But here we can say, yes, there is an effect on the environment.)
Meanwhile, Senator Francis Tolentino brought up the 2023 Oriental Mindoro oil spill and asked what cases had been filed. 
“Matagal-tagal na iyang Mindoro oil spill,” said Tolentino. (A long time has passed since the Mindoro oil spill.)
In this case, it was Pola, Oriental Mindoro Mayor Jennifer Cruz, together with the National Bureau of Investigation Environmental Crime Division, who filed a criminal complaint against the owner of sunken MT Princess Empress. It came three months after the ship sank off Naujan in February 2023. 
MT Terranova sank off Limay, Bataan, more than a month ago. Its sinking was conflated with MTKR Jason Bradley and MV Mirola 1, both of which ran into trouble in Bataan around the same time frame that MT Terranova sank.
The two other ships were plagued by anomalies. MTKR Jason Bradley had a warrant of seizure and detention for its alleged involvement in oil smuggling in 2022, while MV Mirola 1 set sail without clearance from the PCG.
Mary Jane Ubaldo, the owner of MV Mirola 1, recounted during Tuesday’s hearing the events that led to their ship sailing off in July without clearance from the Coast Guard.
Ubaldo said the caretaker of MV Mirola 1 — then anchored in the vicinity of the breakwater in Navotas — “panicked” when waters became rough The caretaker tried to seek safe harbor by asking help from a tugboat’s captain.
The shipowner said: “Habang hinihila na po sila nitong tugboat, naputol po ‘yung pagkakatali. Doon na po nag-umpisa mag-panic ‘yung caretaker ko po. Kasama po kasi niya ‘yung asawa po niya tsaka ‘yung anak niya. Tumalon po sila sa dagat, lumipat po doon sa tugboat. Tapos po, naiwan na po na napapadpad po ‘yung barko.“
(When it was being towed by the tugboat, the line was cut off. That’s when my caretaker started panicking, especially because he was with his wife and child. They jumped into the sea and transferred into the tugboat. Then, the ship was left floating away.)
Ubaldo denied being involved in an oil smuggling incident in the past year but said they had a similar violation of leaving the port without clearance before.
MV Mirola 1 ran aground in Mariveles, Bataan, days before MT Terranova sank. Two days after the MT Terranova incident, MTKR Jason Bradley sank off the waters of Barangay Cabcaben in Mariveles.
As of September 13, the Coast Guard reported that the siphoning of industrial oil from MT Terranova had been completed, with salvage operations to follow. – Rappler.com

1,https://www.rappler.com/philippines/luzon/bataan-coastal-community-pain-oil-spill-disasters/,Bataan coastal community still feels the pain of oil spill disasters,2024-09-17T14:15:46+08:00,"BATAAN, Philippines – Residents of Gatchalian in Cabcaben, Mariveles, Bataan once described their coastal life as abundant and peaceful. Their deep connection to the sea, which provided for their daily needs, was disrupted when oil spills tainted their once-pristine shores.
That tranquility ended on July 27 with the sinking of the MTKR Jason Bradley, which was carrying 5,500 liters of diesel. When Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) personnel arrived that day, they found the vessel abandoned with no crew members in sight.
“Noong araw na iyon, wala silang pupuntahan kundi sa dalampasigan ng Cabcaben at Mt. View. Ngunit, sad to say, wala tayong survivor. Parang inabandona ‘yung barko,” said Reynaldo Castro, barangay chairman of Cabcaben.
(On that day, there was nowhere else they could go except on the shores of Cabcaben and Mt. View. But sad to say, there were no survivors. It was like they abandoned the ship.)
The crisis in Bataan was compounded by a series of maritime disasters in this province. On July 25, the MT Terranova sank in Limay, releasing 100,000 liters of industrial oil into the sea. The MTKR Jason Bradley’s disaster followed soon after, and by July 31, the MV Mirola 1 added to the damage in Sitio Quiapo, Mariveles.
In response, Governor Joet Garcia declared a state of calamity to address the severe impact on 17,000 fishermen and over 15,000 families in Limay and Mariveles.
These oil spills have wreaked havoc on the local fishing industry, severely affecting the likes of 61-year-old Antonio Tagayong. Antonio has fished in Cabcaben for 37 years. He said their fishing trips were delayed for days because of Typhoon Carina before the oil spill occurred. Instead of finding relief after the typhoon, residents were met with a foul stench from their oil-covered shores.
“Dahil sa malalaking alon siguro. Malakas ang hangin. Kaya nalaman na lang namin kinabukasan ng umaga. Marami nang diesel at langis ang nakalutang,” Antonio recounted.
(Perhaps it was because of the big waves and strong wind. We just discovered the next morning there lots of diesel and oil floating.)
For six days after the spill, fishermen faced a fishing ban that left them unable to earn a living from the sea. With no alternative sources of income and struggling with poverty, they eventually resumed fishing in hopes of catching enough crabs to sustain their daily needs.
In response to the challenging situation, the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) provided 5,000 food packs to affected communities. These packs were distributed across twelve barangays in Mariveles, with the assistance of the Municipal Social Welfare and Development Office (MSWDO).
“Kasi wala nga naman silang pagkakakitaan, at wala pang binibigay na tulong mula sa pamahalaan. Kaya ang ginawa nila, lumaot na lang kahit papaano kumikita sila. Lalo na’t malapit na ang pasukan, wala silang ibang mapagkukunan,” he said.
(They did not have other jobs, and the government was not helping them. So what they did was head to the sea and hopefully be able to earn something. Specially now that its almost Christmas, they had to fine way to earn a living.)
Before the oil spill, Antonio earned about P500 pesos a day from selling crabs. Now, with sales plummeting, he struggles to make just P200 pesos. The decline in livelihoods for fishermen and vendors is partly due to health concerns over seafood from oil-affected waters. However, the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) reported on August 12 that fish and shellfish from Bataan, Bulacan, and Pampanga tested negative for oil contamination.
“Para bumaba ‘yung presyo, sasabihin ng namamakyaw sa’min na apektado ng oil spill, pero pagdating naman sa merkado, mahal nilang ibebenta. Nakakain naman namin mga huli namin,” he said.
(To lower the prices, the wholesalers say our catch was affected by the oil spill. But when they resell in the market, they markup the prices. We can actually eat our catch [it’s not contaminated].)
Jonathan Nuñez, 46, has faced similar struggles. He used to earn P2,000 pesos a day from fishing, but now his earnings have dropped to P500, with high fuel costs further cutting into his income.
“Lumaot na kami kahapon. Kaya lang, ‘yung mga isda ayaw pang kuhanin ng mga namimili at mga pumapakyaw ng isda,” he said.
(We went fishing yesterday. But the merchants and wholesalers still refuse to buy our catch.)
Months after the spill, fishermen like Antonio and Jonathan struggle with debt and reduced earnings. They are hoping to receive compensation for the damage to their livelihoods and that their pleas for justice will be heard by the authorities.
As of September 10, the Oil Spill Response Team (OSTR) reports that cleaning operations are ongoing in Cabcaben, with the salvor FES Challenger working on seawater extraction. The MTKR Jason Bradley was scheduled to be refloated on September 14, for further cleanup.
Even with these ongoing efforts, the local economy and the livelihoods of fishermen like Antonio and Jonathan are still deeply affected by the oil spill. They remain hopeful that their fortunes will improve and that they will recover from the losses they have endured. – Rappler.com

In a report to the PCG, Harbor Star said the operations recovered 1,415,954 liters of oil and 17,725 kilograms of solid oil waste or a recovery rate of 97.43%.
Harbor Star said 37,867 liters or 2.57% of the oil cargo from MT Terranova were “lost due to various factors such as biodegradation, dissipation, absorption by sorbent booms, and unpumpable sludge left in the tanks.”
The PCG earlier said 55,512 liters were lost, but later corrected the figure to 37,867 liters.
After the recovery of oil, Harbor Star will conduct a stripping operation to make sure that cargo from oil tanks are completely removed. Salvage operations will commence once done.
The completion of the oil recovery operation comes more than a month after the MT Terranova sank off Limay, Bataan, while carrying 1.4 million liters of industrial fuel oil en route to Iloilo. 
The PCG conducted the final inspection of ground zero on Thursday. 
Meanwhile, investigation to hold concerned parties liable for the oil spill and two other incidents in Bataan — the sunken MTKR Jason Bradley and the MV Mirola 1 which ran aground — continues, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said on Thursday.
“Sa usapin naman ng imbestigasyon, tuloy-tuloy ang paghahanap natin ng sagot sa mga katanungang: May kinalaman ba ang mga barkong ito sa oil smuggling? Bakit ang dalawang barko, sa kabila ng walang rehistro ay napatakbo sa ating karagatan?” Marcos said during an aid distribution event in Navotas on Thursday, according to a Presidential Communications Office press statement.
“Lahat ito ay iniimbestigahan para tiyakin na pananagutin natin ang mga may sala,” he added.
(With regard to the investigation, we continue to looking for answers to these questions: Are these ships involved in oil smuggling? Why were the two ships, despite not being registered, able to set sail in our seas? All of this is being investigated to ensure that all those accountable are held liable.)
The two unregistered ships are the MTKR Jason Bradley and MV Mirola 1. The PCG said in its latest update that the salvor for MTKR Jason Bradley was still installing siphoning pipes to extract seawater, and aims to float the tanker by Saturday, September 14.
“It’s far from over,” fisherfolk group Pagkakaisa ng mga Samahan ng mga Mangingisda sa Pilipinas said on Wednesday, September 11. 
The group demanded that the government “quickly rehabilitate” marine resources and expand assistant not just to fisherfolk but to women engaged in maintenance of equipment and post-harvest operations. 
The Department of Justice had previously floated the possibility of the three tankers being involved in the “paihi” system, or oil smuggling. (READ: Red flags in Bataan? Remulla says billions lost due to oil smuggling)
“Paihi” literally means to urinate in Filipino, but has come to refer to an oil smuggling method where a larger tanker transfers oil to smaller tankers to evade taxes.
Fish in all areas in Manila Bay are safe for human consumption, the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources reported on August 30, even those from hard-hit areas in Cavite. Fishing in the province had also resumed. – Rappler.com

The announcement comes a month after the sinking of the tanker MT Terranova off Bataan last July 25 caused an oil spill.
Fish from Bacoor City, Cavite City, Noveleta, Rosario, and Tanza were still not fit for human consumption, the latest bulletin from the BFAR released a week ago or on August 22 said. 
Once fish from these areas pass another (or third) sensory evaluation, they will be deemed safe for consumption.
In the same bulletin, BFAR said fish from Naic, Ternate, Kawit, and Maragondon were safe to eat. 
“[N]asabihan lang ako ni ating Secretary…Kiko Laurel ng DA [Department of Agriculture] na mula ngayon ay maaari nang mangisda. Wala nang oil spill. Puwede nang ituloy ang inyong hanapbuhay,” Marcos said during his visit in General Trias, Cavite, on Wednesday.
(DA Secretary Kiko Laurel just told me that you can resume fishing. There’s no oil spill anymore. You can now continue your livelihood.)
Marcos, together with Agriculture Secretary Francisco Tiu Laurel Jr., went to General Trias to distribute P363,050,000 worth of aid, according to a statement from the Presidential Communications Office.
Cavite province had announced a no-catch zone for shellfish a few days after MT Terranova sank and the oil spill reached the shores of its coastal towns.
Cavite Governor Jonvic Remulla said on Thursday, August 29, that fisherfolk can resume catching mussels and clams. 
Around 31,000 fishers and vendors from Cavite want compensation in light of the maritime disaster. (READ: Cavite fishers, vendors want P350 daily compensation from MT Terranova owner)
Oil siphoning from MT Terranova was still ongoing as of Thursday. The Philippine Coast Guard reported that salvor Harbor Star had collected 806,254 liters of oil and seawater from MT Terranova in a span of 10 days or nearly 60% of its oil cargo. 
Harbor Star said they have been siphoning oily waste from the vessel at 24,614 liters per hour.
MT Terranova sank off Limay, Bataan, on July 25. It was carrying 1.4 million liters of industrial fuel oil chartered by San Miguel Shipping subsidiary SL Harbor Bulk Terminal Corporation. 
The Coast Guard initially said the oil siphoning would only take a week since the sunken ship was just 34 meters under water. The President said on Wednesday the Coast Guard expects the siphoning to be completed in two weeks. 
MT Terranova’s sinking, alongside the cases of two other troubled vessels in Bataan, is being investigated by the Department of Justice and is the subject of congressional hearings. – Rappler.com

The siphoning operations are being conducted by Harbor Star Shipping Services, the company contracted by MT Terranova owner Shogun Ships to siphon the oil and salvage the ship.
According to the PCG, Harbor Star said the rate of oil flow as of Thursday was around 7,200 liters per hour, which would be equivalent to 172,800 liters per day. The PCG targets to extract 200,000 liters per day.
In the past week, the salvor had started to remove oil initially to determine the rate of oil flow. The plan is to remove all contaminants and float the tanker, before towing it to the shoreline. 
Meanwhile, a water cannon was deployed on Thursday in response to the oil sheen observed in the area.  
MT Terranova sank off Limay, Bataan, on July 25. It was carrying 1.4 million liters of industrial fuel oil, chartered by San Miguel Shipping subsidiary SL Harbor Bulk Terminal Corporation.

Remulla says billions lost due to oil smuggling,2024-08-15T11:44:39+08:00,"MANILA, Philippines – With allegations of oil smuggling emerging after three vessels transporting petroleum ran into trouble off the waters of Bataan, Department of Justice (DOJ) Secretary Jesus Crispin “Boying” Remulla said the Philippines may be losing billions in revenue because of the “paihi” system.
“Paihi” literally means to urinate in Filipino, but has come to refer to an oil smuggling method where a larger tanker transfers oil to smaller tankers to evade taxes.
The justice secretary said the oil spill incident following the sinking of MT Terranova, MT Jason Bradley, and the running aground of MV Mirola 1 in Bataan had “opened another Pandora’s box about what’s happening in the Philippines that has been silently tolerated for the longest time.”
“[S]a aking tingin, pwedeng umabot ito ng daang bilyon na nawawala sa atin dahil sa mga sindikato na nananaig sa paihi ng fuel,” said Remulla in a press conference on Wednesday, August 14.
(In my view, what we lose because of oil smuggling syndicates could reach billions.) 
Remulla said they are already asking the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) for an estimate of loss revenue due to oil smuggling.
In 2019, the Philippine government launched the Fuel Marking Program which imposes “the mandatory marking of refined, manufactured, or imported gasoline, diesel and kerosene in the Philippines” after taxes and duties have been paid. The BIR and the Bureau of Customs (BOC) lead the implementation.  
The Philippine Institute of Petroleum, a group of industry players, has since expressed support for the government’s initiative to curb oil smuggling. 
Since 2019 and up to May 2024, the government reportedly marked P908.52 billion worth of fuel.
To recap, MV Mirola 1 ran aground in Mariveles on July 23. MV Mirola 1 reportedly sailed from Navotas without clearance from the Coast Guard.
On the same day at 11 pm, MT Terranova carrying 1.4 million liters of industrial fuel oil, departed Lamao Point in Limay en route to Iloilo. 
According to the Coast Guard’s report during the Senate hearing on Wednesday, MT Terranova reached the vicinity of Limbones Island in Cavite on July 24 at 4 am. The crew heard a loud bang and the starboard main engine suddenly stopped. They decided to go back to Bataan.
Around 6:30 pm on July 24, Mtug Procyon arrived to tow MT Terranova back to Lamao, but the latter started listing. On July 25, the tanker capsized and submerged.
Two days after MT Terranova submerged, MT Jason Bradley sank off Mariveles, Bataan on July 27 while it was anchored. It was loaded with 5,500 liters of diesel oil.
In a Teleradyo interview on Wednesday, DOJ Undersecretary Raul Vasquez mentioned that there were several “red flags” that came out as they were investigating the Bataan maritime incidents.
Vasquez mentioned that:
“It’s always one thing to say na it’s possible na intentional act ‘yan at may conspiracy,” said Vasquez. “It’s only when it’s so clear na wala that you go to other areas and other causes of action na tinatawag.”

The Biodiversity Management Bureau (BMB) under the DENR assessed critical ecosystems within a 30-kilometer radius from ground zero where MT Terranova sank. These potentially affected areas are: 
“These are areas which we continue to watch and monitor,” said Environment Secretary Toni Yulo-Loyzaga on Wednesday during the Senate hearing. 
Asian waterbird census sites are natural and man-made wetlands which are crucial habitats for migratory birds. An example is the Las Piñas-Parañaque Wetland Park, a protected area located south of Manila Bay. Staff of the wetland park recently completed four improvised 100-meter oil spill booms.
The BMB noted that the assessment is still subject to onsite validation. The results were last updated on August 4. 
MT Terranova, owned by Shogun Ships Company Incorporated, capsized and submerged at 1:10 am on July 25 off Limay, Bataan. It was carrying 1.4 million liters of industrial fuel oil, chartered by San Miguel Shipping subsidiary SL Harbor Bulk Terminal Corporation. It started leaking black oil which spread to parts of Cavite and Bataan. 
In Cavite, coastal residents cleaned up oil slicks that wound up on their shores a few days after the tanker submerged. 
Salvor Harbor Star initally put canvas bags to contain the leak and when these bags were filled, it placed metal caps on the leaking valves of MT Terranova. It took the salvor three weeks to secure all 24 valves of the ships’ tanks before siphoning operations began on Tuesday, August 13. 
Fishing has been banned in Limay, Bataan. Cavite has put several coastal towns under a state of calamity and announced a no-catch zone for shellfish. A Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) bulletin released on Tuesday, August 13, deemed fish and shellfish from Cavite still unsafe for human consumption. 
There is no update yet on the projected cost of environmental damage in Manila Bay. Last year, when the MT Princess Empress sank off Naujan in Oriental Mindoro, the DENR estimated that damage may reach P7 billion after most of the tanker’s over 800,000 liters of black oil cargo spilled into the sea.  
Alongside critical ecosystems in Manila Bay are reclamation projects which have been under review for over a year. 
Loyzaga said on Wednesday that the interim results from the cumulative impact assessment of reclamations show that these projects slow down circulation in the Bay area. 
In light of an oil spill, reclamations could make it harder for pollutants to drain out of Manila Bay, said Loyzaga.
Senate Majority Leader Francis Tolentino asked the environment secretary if reclamations could help prevent the spread of an oil spill or exacerbate the spread instead.
“It could actually exacerbate the impacts of these types of events, the oil spill,” said Loyzaga. “So the drainage of the pollutants from the Bay are what are affected by any changes that are being done in the coastal area.”  
President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. suspended reclamation projects in Manila Bay last year. 
In a previous Senate hearing on flood control projects last August 1, Loyzaga said that two reclamations are ongoing out of the 22 suspended.  
While the results of the assessment may be released by September, Loyzaga noted that “there will be an ecological cost and an economic cost to introducing anything into Manila Bay.” – Rappler.com

The BFAR has been conducting sensory evaluation of fish samples from Bataan, Bulacan, and Pampanga since MT Terranova sank off Limay, Bataan, on July 25 and caused an oil spill.
Results from sensory evaluations of fish and shellfish samples from these three provinces do not have traces of oil and grease, BFAR said.
Similarly, chemical testing from samples in Bataan and Bulacan showed that concentrations of polycylic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)– the toxic components of oil – “are significantly below levels of concern and pose no significant risk to public health.”
However, fish and shellfish from Cavite “are still not safe for human consumption based on sensory evaluation,” BFAR cautioned the public.
Samples collected from other sites – Navotas, Manila, Parañaque, Las Piñas, and Batangas – were deemed free from oil and grease contamination.
Most affected by the oil spill are fisherfolk from Cavite and Bataan, as consumers remain averse from buying fishery products in light of the maritime disaster.
Justice Undersecretary Raul Vasquez said 21,000 affected residents in Bataan will get compensation in insurance.
This comes after the earlier reported number of 31,000 Cavite fishers and vendors that will be receiving compensation.
Vasquez also mentioned that by the Philippines’ Oil Pollution Compensation Act, there is a $6.5 million fund reserved for expenses that will compensate affected communities.
The law implements the 1992 Civil Liability Convention and the 1992 Fund Convention. The Philippines is a signatory to the two conventions, but not the Supplementary Fund Protocol which could beef up the available fund for a major oil spill incident.
“All expenses of local government units and government agencies similar to the Mindoro oil spill, we told them to document that so they can claim later on for reimbursement and compensation also,” said Vasquez.

As part of initial siphoning operations, the salvor began hot tapping one of the eight tanks inside the ship. Lieutenant Commander Michael John Encina explained that hot tapping meant putting a pipe on the surface of the tank where water could go through.
“Through water flooding, the oil will surface. And then the oil on the surface will be siphoned,” Encina explained in a mix of Filipino and English.
This method, Encina said, would reduce risk of any unnecessary movement while the salvor removes contaminants.
Through the initial oil siphoning, the salvor can assess the flow rate of the oil that will help them determine the timeline for when they may start full-blown siphoning operations.
All 24 valves have been sealed, half of which had canvas seals installed, while the other half had fabricated metal caps. The PCG earlier estimated that it would take two weeks for the metal caps to be fabricated and installed. 
Initially, the Coast Guard said the plan was to siphon out around 300,000 liters of industrial fuel oil to float MT Terranova. But now, all contaminants will be removed from the tanker before it gets towed to the shoreline.
“The intention is to extract all the contaminants before the conduct of salvage operation,” said Encina. “That means all IFO (industrial fuel oil) will be extracted to ensure that there will be no contaminants on board.”
MT Terranova, owned by Shogun Ships Company Incorporated, capsized and submerged at 1:10 am on July 25 off Limay, Bataan. It was carrying 1.4 million liters of industrial fuel oil, chartered by San Miguel Shipping subsidiary SL Harbor Bulk Terminal Corporation.
As the salvor slowly starts the process of siphoning out oil from the tanker, the government continues to investigate circumstances surrounding the Bataan oil spill and the other troubled vessels. 
The Department of Justice is looking at a possible oil smuggling case where MT Terranova, along with other troubled vessels MT Jason Bradley and MV Mirola 1, are involved. (READ: Was MT Terranova, other troubled ships in Bataan involved in oil smuggling?)
“The Jason Bradley, in fact, has a seizure order from [the Bureau of] Customs because it was involved in a pending case due to oil smuggling,” DOJ Undersecretary Raul Vasquez told reporters on Tuesday in Filipino.
“That’s according to the investigation of the NBI [National Bureau of Investigation] when they were verifying records.”
The justice undersecretary pointed out that Jason Bradley and MV Mirola 1, which ran aground in Mariveles, sailed without clearance from the PCG. MV Mirola 1 is also an unregistered vessel, said Vasquez.
MT Jason Bradley sank on July 27 off Mariveles.
In a statement dated July 27, chief engineer Juanito Canillo said they encountered strong winds and heavy swells during their prolonged stay at anchorage. Canillo said their situation “deteriorated significantly” as they neared shallow waters.
“During the lifting of the anchor and maneuvering, we were struck by three successive waves, causing the vessel to capsize,” Canillo’s statement read.
“At approximately 1230 or 1240 hours, we were forced to abandon the vessel as it was sinking.”
The PCG reported on Monday, August 12, that MT Jason Bradley is now partially afloat as seawater is being siphoned out of the tanker.
The said vessel may be expected to fully float within two weeks, Encina said. – Rappler.com

Shogun Ships’ primary purpose is to engage in “the general business of domestic shipping, to own and operate vessels of any class, type of description of domestic trade, to charter in and out such vessel.”
Its officers are:
The majority of shares are owned by the Cordero family, with Vicente Cordero Jr. owning 45% of shares, exceeding that of Cordero Alliance Holdings at 37.20%.
Vicente Cordero III, who currently serves as Shogun Ships’ president, owns 2.19% of shares. The company’s total paid-up capital is P1 billion.
Since the sinking of MT Terranova, only Leonelle Mojal-Infante, carrying the name of Portavaga Ship Management Incorporated, gave an interview to deny the allegations that their tanker was involved in oil smuggling. The Department of Justice had said that they are currently investigating the events that led to the oil spill, looking at the possibility that the “paihi” system — where a large tanker transfers oil to smaller tankers to evade taxes — was carried out. 
Portavaga was registered with the SEC on March 28, 2011.
Its primary purpose is “to carry on the business of ship management and to act as agent, broker, ship chandler, or representative of foreign shipping corporation and individuals.”
The company’s revenue for 2023 reported to the SEC amounted to P113,278,229. Revenue pertains to “services provided to Shogun Ships. Co. Inc. for vessel operations and crewing management,” according to their financial statements covering 2022 to 2023.
Portavaga’s officers are:
Its total paid-up capital is P500,000, raised by five stockholders.
Both SSCI and Portavaga’s office are in Pasig City, around three kilometers away from each other.
Aside from transport of petroleum products, Shogun Ships has also ventured into the passenger sector.
It owns Island Water, a company that owns and operates roll-on/roll-off (RoRo) vessels. On its website, Island Water says it aims to “provide high quality service with a touch and feel of a cruise ship.”
The RoRo vessels that Island Water owns include the following:
These ships ply routes from Batangas to Abra de Ilog in Occidental Mindoro, and from Batangas to Puerto Galera.
In 2019, Shogun Ships supported the government’s Cavite-Metro Manila ferry service, giving free rides on the MV Island Sabtang for the first month. 
While they have been in talks with local governments and the Philippine Coast Guard for compensation and oil spill response, Shogun Ships has yet to formally address the public and answer questions on accountability in relation to the maritime disaster.
On the night of July 24, MT Terranova started listing on Bataan waters while being towed by a tugboat. The next day, the ship sank. Shogun Ships had contracted salvor Harbor Star to conduct siphoning and salvage operations. – Rappler.com

10,https://www.rappler.com/philippines/coast-guard-confirms-minimal-oil-leak-mt-terranova/,Philippine Coast Guard confirms 'minimal' oil leak from MT Terranova,2024-07-27T12:50:15+08:00,"MANILA, Philippines – The Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) has confirmed that the sunken MT Terranova is leaking “minimal” amounts of oil from valves, though the situation remains “manageable” as much of the tanker remains intact underwater.
“As observed, it’s not yet alarming since only a little is coming out and the tanker itself is still intact,” PCG spokesperson Rear Admiral Armando Balilo said in Filipino during a press conference on Saturday, July 27.
Balilo said that divers from Harbor Star Shipping Services conducted an initial assessment of the ship earlier on Saturday and found leaks coming from the tanker’s valves. The PCG could not immediately confirm the number of leaks found or the amount of oil already spilled.
The PCG also said the oil spill has grown to between 12 to 14 kilometers long, based on an aerial survey report by the Philippine Space Agency and reports on the ground. However, because the oil found was not too dark, it’s possible that the oil spill includes a mix of both operational oil from the ship and industrial fuel oil from its cargo.
Local governments have also been told to brace for the effects of the oil spill. Based on the current trajectory of the oil spill, it could possibly affect communities in Bataan and Cavite.
Saturday’s diving team had been on standby since Friday, July 26, but waited for the weather and sea condition to improve before continuing the operation.
Oil tanker MT Terranova was carrying 1.4 million liters of industrial fuel oil when it sank on Thursday, July 25, off Bataan province. The PCG said that attempts are now underway to recover its cargo before it causes a wider oil spill.
Shogun Ships Company Incorporated, owner of the sunken ship, has tapped Harbor Star Shipping Services to salvage the tanker and respond to the oil spill. Harbor Star was also among the companies that responded to the Mindoro oil spill in 2023 caused by the sinking of oil tanker MT Princess Empress.
Optimistically, the PCG estimates that it could complete siphoning within seven days, considering the oil tanker sank in shallow waters.
However, Balilo said that under the “worst-case scenario,” the oil spill could stretch all the way into the vicinity waters of Parañaque, Manila, Navotas, Bulacan, and Pampanga. The coast guard has already deployed oil containment booms.
According to Limay Mayor Nelson David, around 400 to 500 liters of the vessel’s engine fuel leaked out. Authorities have observed an oil slick in the area, although there are no reports yet if the industrial fuel oil of the tanker was already spilling.
“There’s nothing to worry about, but we would not be complacent,” PCG spokesperson Rear Admiral Armando Balilo said in Filipino on Friday, July 26.
“We are still preparing for the worst-case scenario to address the potential negative impact to the marine environment.” – Rappler.com

The no-cure, no-pay contract between both parties includes oil spill response operations to minimize  possible environmental damage, Harbor Star told the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) on Friday, July 26. The maritime services provider immediately sent its tugboats and salvage equipment to Bataan. 
A no-cure, no pay contract means that Harbor Star will not be paid if it is unable to fulfill the terms of the  agreement. 
The Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) reported that MT Terranova capsized and eventually submerged at 1:10 am on Thursday, around 3.6 nautical miles or around seven kilometers east off Lamao Point in Limay, Bataan. Sixteen crew members were rescued while the body of the last missing crew member was located by BRP Melchora Aquino later in the afternoon.
The maritime incident happened even though the weather disturbance from the southwest monsoon or habagat had already weakened on Thursday. 
Harbor Star was one of the companies tapped in last year’s Mindoro oil spill, after MT Princess Empress sank on February 23, 2023 off the coast of Naujan, Oriental Mindoro. Similar to this new incident, MT Princess Empress left Limay, Bataan with 900,000 liters of industrial fuel oil. It was owned by Reield Marine Services and was chartered by a San Miguel shipping subsidiary to transport the black oil to Iloilo. 
Limay Mayor Nelson David told Radyo 360 on Friday that around 400 to 500 liters of the vessel’s engine fuel leaked. There are no reports yet if the industrial fuel oil it was carrying was already spilling, as of writing. 
The Department of Environment and Natural Resources has deployed its survey vessel BRG Hydrographer Presbitero to locate the sunken ship. 
PCG also deployed three 44-meter multi-role response vessels for the oil spill response operations.
“These vessels will start the application of oil dispersants to immediately mitigate impact, especially during the period where siphoning is being prepared,” said PCG Commandant Ronnie Gil Gavan on Thursday. 
According to Gavan, the PCG hopes to finish siphoning operations in seven days.
“The vessel sunk 34 meters deep which is considerably shallow. Siphoning will not be very technical and can be done quickly to protect the vicinity waters of Bataan and Manila Bay against environmental, social, economic, financial, and political impacts,” said PCG spokesperson Rear Admiral Armando Balilo. 
However, the spokesperson said they are still preparing for the worst-case scenario. At 1 pm Friday, PCG officials met with representatives from SSCI and salvor Harbor Star to discuss the timeline of siphoning operations.
“Walang dapat ipag-alala, pero hindi kami nagpapakampante,” Balilo said. (There’s nothing to worry about, but we will not be complacent.)
In the worst-case scenario, vicinity waters of Parañaque, Manila, Navotas, Bulacan, and Pampanga would be affected.
“We are utilizing our manpower, mobilizing our resources, consulting with experts, and collaborating with LGUs and other stakeholders to avoid a marine environment catastrophe,” said Balilo.
Balilo also clarified there was no public storm warning signal raised over Bataan when MT Terranova set sail. 
Currently, the PCG is conducting a joint marine casualty investigation with the Maritime Industry Authority.
The Philippines’ largest oil firm Petron Corporation has volunteered to help in the oil spill response. Petron, part of the San Miguel Group of companies, operates a refinery in Limay.
Groups have called on the government and the shipowner to control the spread of the oil spill to prevent harm to the environment and coastal communities. 
“The owners of MT Terranova and its cargo must come forward and claim responsibility: foot the bill for any environmental damage this may cause, and provide compensation to the communities affected,” said Jefferson Chua, climate campaigner for Greenpeace.
“The government must also ensure that the full weight of our legal system is applied to ensuring justice for the people of Limay and the other communities in the area,” Chua added.
International organization Oceana stressed the implementation of the recently passed Philippine Ecosystem and Natural Cost Accounting System (PENCAS) law to estimate the cost incurred from the maritime disaster. 
“All those responsible for failing to prevent this tragedy – from concerned government agencies to private owners of the tanker – should be held accountable,” said Gloria Estenzo Ramos, vice president of Oceana. 
“Considering the oil spills’ destructive impacts on our fishing grounds and habitats, not to mention that majority of our population rely on a healthy and productive marine ecosystems for sustenance, it is time to impose even higher penalties and stricter accountability measures and implement the PENCAS law,” added Ramos. – Rappler.com

Encina said the 14 leaking valves of the submerged tanker have been closed on Monday. Siphoning would start as soon as all valves, including the ones without leaks, are sealed.
“That will be the main activity of our operation tomorrow: the siphoning process,” Encina said in a mix of Filipino and English.
“So technically the salvor will siphon 300,000 liters of IFO (industrial fuel oil) to float MT Terranova. Hence after that, we can bring the vessel near the shoreline so we can do other measures to avert the oil spill.”
Even valves without leaks must be sealed too because when the vessel lifts as the oil is siphoned out, they might open, Encina explained.
Siphoning may last from five to seven days. Encina said a conservative estimate would be 10 days. The Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) had earlier set a 7-day target last week. PCG spokesperson Rear Admiral Armand Balilo said earlier in a radio interview on Monday morning that 15 valves were yet to be sealed. 
The contracted salvor for this oil spill response is Harbor Star, under a no-cure, no-pay contract with ship owner Shogun Ships Company Incorporated. 
En route to Iloilo, MT Terranova was carrying 1.4 million liters of industrial fuel oil when it sank 3.6 nautical miles from Lamao point in Limay, Bataan. One crew member died in the maritime incident, while 16 other crew were rescued. The Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources estimated that 11,000 fisherfolk from Bataan will be affected under the worst-case scenario. 
Reports of oil slick sightings have come in from Bulacan and Cavite, two provinces where scientists have forecast the oil to spread.
Aside from capping the valves, the PCG had deployed oil spill booms to contain spread. They have also started to make improvised booms from coconut husks.
However, oil spill booms only work in calm sea conditions, Natalie Kirk, a representative from non-government organization International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation Limited (ITOPF) said during a meeting with concerned government officials in Pampanga province on Monday, July 29.
“So if we have rough weather…it doesn’t work. And at best, the estimates are that we can recover about 10 to 20% of the oil spilt using containment and recovery,” said Kirk.
The ITOPF representative said the most effective way of responding to the oil spill is to concentrate on the salvage efforts and in removing the oil from the vessel. – Rappler.com

CG Rear Admiral Armando Balilo, spokesman of the PCG, said Coast Guard divers sealed the leaks found on the vessel.
The shipping company initially said that it had no cargo fuel onboard. However, the PCG found an unknown amount of diesel cargo on the vessel.
“The PCG response team is working on properly removing the diesel cargo with the help of a contracted salvor,” the PCG said, adding that it will conduct an investigation after recovering the cargo.
The oil tanker sank 9 meters deep off the waters of Barangay Cabcaben in Mariveles Bataan. It was found 600 yards away from the shore.
According to an initial report from the PCG, three 44-meter Coast Guard vessels were sent to respond to the incident at 5 pm on Saturday, July 27.
“As of press time, the shipping company is preparing the equipment needed for the salvage operations that will be completed in one to two weeks,” the PCG said in its initial statement on Sunday.
The MTKR Jason Bradley is the second oil tanker that sank off waters of Bataan within days. 
MT Terranova, which was carrying 1.4 million liters of industrial fuel oil, capsized and submerged off the waters of Bataan on July 25. The PCG is hoping that siphoning operations for the oil spill may be finished within a week. – Rappler.com

PCG personnel were manually scooping out the oil inside the vessel. They would then bring the recovered oil in a waste disposal facility to avoid posing health risks to residents.
The vessel was reported on July 23 to have run aground in the vicinity waters of Sitio Quiapo, Barangay Biaan in Mariveles. (Editor’s Note: An earlier version of this story said the vessel ran aground on July 31. This has been corrected.)
A team from the PCG and Bataan’s provincial disaster risk reduction and management office observed “minimal oil sheens and light smell of diesel oil” in the area. The team took water samples for analysis. 
MV Mirola 1 is the third vessel to run into trouble in the waters of Bataan, after MT Terranova and MKTR Jason Bradley sank in the past week. 
Last week, MT Terranova capsized and submerged off Limay, Bataan. En route to Iloilo, it was carrying 1.4 million liters of industrial fuel oil. The PCG has yet to start siphoning of oil as sealing of valves was still ongoing. – Rappler.com

The DA validated that 28,373 fisherfolk are affected out of the projected 46,090.
Since the oil spill in Bataan after oil tanker MT Terranova capsized and submerged on July 25, fishing had been banned in Limay, Bataan. Cavite had declared a no-catch zone on all shellfish products.
Bataan Governor Jose Enrique Garcia III recently placed the province under a state of calamity, estimating around 17,000 fisherfolk affected.
A state of calamity was also declared in several coastal towns in Cavite.
Cavite Governor Jonvic Remulla said 31,000 fisherfolk and vendors could expect a compensation of P350 a day until people regain confidence in buying fishery products.
The Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources cautioned the public against consuming fish caught in areas where oil slicks have been observed.
The salvor is set to siphon the oil out of MT Terranova soon, after all fabricated metal caps have been installed on the tanker’s valves. The Philippine Coast Guard and salvor Harbor Star simulated the siphoning operations on Wednesday.
Aside from containment and community assistance, the Department of Justice is investigating the circumstances that led to the oil spill as well as the liable parties.

16,https://www.rappler.com/philippines/was-mt-terranova-other-troubled-ships-bataan-involved-oil-smuggling/,"Was MT Terranova, other troubled ships in Bataan involved in oil smuggling?",2024-08-05T14:44:19+08:00,"MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Justice (DOJ) is investigating whether sunken MT Terranova and two other troubled vessels in Bataan were involved in the “paihi” system or oil smuggling.
“May intelligence reports naman na ‘paihi’ system ang umiral,” Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin “Boying” Remulla said in a DZRH radio interview on August 3, Saturday. (There are intelligence reports that the ‘paihi‘ system was carried out.)
The term “paihi” literally means to urinate in Filipino, but has come to refer to an oil smuggling method where a large tanker transfers oil to smaller tankers to evade taxes.
“Tapos ‘yung isa pang tumaob na vessel…walang makina. Pero malaki ang fuel berth niya. Malaki ang kanyang cargo area. Ginawa nilang tanker pero hinihila lang.” (And then the other vessel that capsized had no engine. But it has a huge fuel berth. It has a large cargo area. They used it as a tanker that could be towed.)
Remulla said the Philippine Coast Guard traced the movement of MT Terranova through its global positioning system device and found that it had been circling in vicinity waters of Bataan for 26 hours since it sailed last July 23.
“Doon sila nagpapaihi. Doon sila nagbebenta ng smuggled fuel,” said Remulla. (That’s where they sell smuggled fuel.)
MT Terranova, owned by Shogun Ships Company Incorporated, capsized and submerged at 1:10 am on July 25 off Limay, Bataan. It was carrying 1.4 million liters of industrial fuel oil, chartered by San Miguel Shipping subsidiary SL Harbor Bulk Terminal Corporation. 
The night before or at 10:57 pm on July 24, MT Terranova started listing (or tilting to one side) while it was being towed by tugboat MTug Procyon en route to the anchorage area. Metro Manila and other parts of Luzon were then still grappling with the impact of the southwest monsoon or habagat enhanced by Typhoon Carina. 
MT Terranova started spilling industrial fuel oil hours later. The shipowner then contracted maritime services firm Harbor Star to salvage the tanker and to help in the oil spill cleanup. Harbor Star plugged the oil leak with canvas bags, but these bags eventually got filled with oil leaks. It said it would have to fabricate metals caps to plug the leaking valves, thus delaying the oil siphoning operations by two weeks. 
On July 27, Saturday, two days after MT Terranova sank, the Coast Guard confirmed the sinking of MTKR Jason Bradley also in Bataan, complicating further the cleanup operations. The ship was carrying 5,500 liters of diesel although the ship owner initially denied the tanker was carrying fuel. 
On the same day that MT Terranova sailed on July 23, the Coast Guard received a report that another vessel, MV Mirola 1, ran aground in Mariveles, Bataan. 
Remulla earlier said his department was probing whether all three cases of troubled vessels in Bataan were related. 
“All three are interconnected, we believe,” Remulla told reporters on Friday, August 2. “The first two vessels especially. First two vessels.”
The justice chief said a class action lawsuit is being eyed against the shipowner and others involved.
“We’re looking into the angle of a class suit already filed by the fishermen against the owners and others who may responsible for this,” said Remulla. He claimed that “the country has not seen a case like this filed yet.”
Meantime, Leonelle Mojal-Infante, spokesperson of shipowner Portavaga Ship Management Incorporated, denied the justice secretary’s allegation in an interview with ABS-CBN News on Monday, August 5. 
She said MT Terranova could not have been engaged in the “paihi” system or oil smuggling because the seals of the tanker can only be opened in its delivery destination.
“Nabubuksan lang ‘yan ng kung saan ‘yan i-de-deliver. So ang magbubukas lang niyan ‘yung pag-de-deliveran mo. So it is not possible na ‘yung mga lumalabas na kesyo nagpaihi or something, hindi siya possible sa barko namin,” she said. 
(It could only be opened where it will be delivered. It can only be opened by the receiver. So it’s not possible, the allegations that came out about oil smuggling or something, that’s not possible in our ship.)
Mojal-Infante also said they have all the proper permits from the Maritime Industry Authority, the Philippine Ports Authority, and the Coast Guard.
“We only deal with reputable oil companies in the Philippines and lahat po ‘yun ay (all are) under a legitimate contract,” she said. (We only deal with reputable oil companies in the Philippines and all of those are under a legitimate contract.) 
Cavite Governor Jonvic Remulla, the justice secretary’s brother, told Noveleta residents on Saturday that the shipowner will be sued in a bid to get compensation for affected communities.
“Kakasuhan po natin ang may-ari ng barko para lahat kayo ay mabayaran sa nangyari dito sa Noveleta, nangyari sa distrito ng buong coastal ng Cavite,” he said. 
(We will file a case against the shipowner so that everyone in Noveleta, the whole coastal district of Cavite, will get compensation.)
The Cavite governor declared parts of the province under a state of calamity after the Bataan oil spill reached their shores last week. Remulla said the estimated cost of damage in Cavite could reach P1 billion, with 25,000 fisherfolk affected in the province.
Fisherfolk group Pamalakaya said on Monday, August 5, that the government must step up efforts to help fishers from Cavite and Bataan whose livelihood are at risk in light of the maritime disaster.
“Dapat hindi na makatakas sa pananagutan ang kumpanyang sangkot sa oil spill, na nauna nang tinukoy ng Philippine Coast Guard na may kaugnayan sa San Miguel Corporation,” said Ronnel Arambulo, vice chairperson of Pamalakaya, in a statement.
“Ito rin ang parehong kumpanya na sangkot sa mapaminsalang oil spill sa Oriental Mindoro noong nakaraang taon, na hanggang ngayon ay pinagdudusahan pa rin ng mga mangingisda.”
(The company involved in the oil spill, which the Philippine Coast Guard confirmed has ties with San Miguel Corporation, shouldn’t get away. This is the same company involved in the disastrous oil spill in Oriental Mindoro the past year, which until now fisherfolk are suffering from.)
The Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources distributed food packs to 1,612 fisherfolk in Noveleta on Saturday. – Rappler.com
