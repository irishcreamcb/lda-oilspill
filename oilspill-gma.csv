""As we see from this image it has spread quite quickly towards the Bulacan area,"" the Environment Secretary said.
 
Meanwhile, a UP Marine Science Institute model run of the spill based from the Philippine Space Agency (PhilSA) showed that the coastlines of Bulacan will be affected ""if the weather conditions continue,"" Yulo-Loyzaga said.
""We just got word that there are sightings of the flow towards Corregidor,"" Yulo-Loyzaga added. ""Cavite would be an area of possible impact.""
Marcos also inquired if the initial assessment of the oil spill reaching 60 kilometers north of Metro Manila was maintained.
""Bulacan would be the main site, Mr. President,"" Yulo-Loyzaga responded. ""At this point, if the weather persists, because we are dependent on wind and currents, we are also dependent on the capping of leaks and the intervention at the vessel site.""
The DENR has already conducted anticipatory action to monitor changes in NCR, Regions 3 and 4-A to anticipate possible change in the trajectory of the oil spill.
Marcos, with advice from the DENR, has ordered the provincial governments that will possibly be affected to install organic spill booms along coastal areas to prevent the spread of oil spill.

According to a ""24 Oras"" report by Mark Salazar on Tuesday, oil slick samples have already been collected at Tanza, Cavite.
The University of the Philippines Marine Science Institute estimated the leakage to reach Cavite shores by Monday and Metro Manila by Tuesday.
If left uncontrolled, the oil spill may affect over 46,000 fishermen in Central Luzon, Region 4A, and National Capital Region.
Despite this, some fishermen said they have not seen any signs of an oil spill.
“Kung meron yan [na oil spill], siguradong pati kami matataranta. Kawawa ang hanapbuhay namin niyan,” said fisherman Julius Rodriguez.
(If there was [an oil spill], we would be in panic. Our livelihood would be at stake)
“Sa ngayon dito, di pa naman po. Ayos pa naman ang bentahan [ng tahong] kasi malinaw naman ang dagat dito,” added fisherman Junnel Bin.
(As of now, not yet. The sales [of oysters] are still alright as the seas are still clear here)
The Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources has not implemented a fishing ban as leaking valves were immediately closed and the spill was contained.
In a virtual press conference by the Philippine Coast Guard on Tuesday afternoon, it was disclosed that oil siphoning in the area has been postponed as only 18 out of the 24 leaking valves of the MT Terra Nova had been sealed.
“Nasa local government units na ang pagpapasya kung magdedeklara sila [ng fishing ban]. Ang mandato po ngayon ng BFAR ay siguraduhin na patuloy ang assessment at evaluation patungkol dun sa kaligtasan sa pagkonsumo ng isda doon sa mga apektadong lugar,” said BFAR spokesperson Nazario Briguera.
(The local government units will decide if they will declare [a fishing ban]. The current mandate of the BFAR is to ensure continuous assessment and evaluation regarding the safety of fish consumption in affected areas)
Meanwhile, experts say that the oil spill had reportedly begun to affect marine life in Manila Bay.
“I can say dito, sa Manila Bay, meron pa rin siyang mga coral reef areas diyan sa may mouth [at sa] may Corregidor, Mariveles area, and meron na ring sightings na umabot na rin doon [ang spillage]. Hindi namin alam kung gaano kalala ang impact doon. Wala kasi kaming personnel on the ground eh, so it's the Coast Guard and BFAR and DENR doing the ground assessment,” said Dr. Cesar Villanoy of the UP-MSI.
(I can say that here, at the Manila Bay, there are still coral reef areas at the mouth [and at] Corregidor, Mariveles area, and there are also sightings that [the spillage] has reached there. We still don’t know how bad the impact is there. We don’t have any personnel on the ground, so it’s the Coast Guard and BFAR and DENR doing the ground assessment)
BFAR added that while the oil spill is under control, a clean-up operation would have to be conducted for the affected nearby shores.
“Kapag magiging bahagi tayo ng clean-up, dapat may protective equipment po tayo. Wag po basta basta magkakaroon ng contact dun sa oil slick kasi yung amoy nito, lalo na dun sa mga asthmatic, pwedeng makaapekto,” said Briguera.

On their second oil spill bulletin issued on Thursday, BFAR found some degree of tainting with petrochemicals in fish samples collected from Noveleta and Rosario in Cavite, despite the testing being conducted before oil slicks were observed in the area.
No contamination was found in samples from Tanza and Cavite City.
Bataan has declared a state of calamity after oil tanker MT Terranova carrying over 1.4 million liters of fuel oil capsized off the town of Limay.
A fishing ban was imposed in Limay while the province of Cavite is now a no-catch zone for all types of shellfish.
BFAR continues to monitor fish and markets in affected areas to ensure the safety and quality of seafood for consumption.

""In the province of Cavite, fish and shellfish samples collected are still not safe for human consumption based on sensory evaluation,"" it added.
BFAR said since the onset of the oil spill in Limay, Bataan, BFAR has been conducting on-ground monitoring and assessment of potentially affected fishing areas and communities surrounding Manila Bay.
It said fish samples are regularly collected and analyzed for traces of oil and grease and harmful contaminants polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH).
“These tests are important to ensure that fish caught in the potentially affected areas are free from contamination and safe for public consumption,” BFAR said.
It said fish from Batangas, particularly in Nasugbu, Lian, and Calatagan, were labelled safe based on testing on Aug. 9.
Meanwhile, samples from Bataan, Bulacan, and Pampanga have consistently shown no oil and grease contamination since August 12.
The agency noted low levels of concern for harmful contaminant polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), posing no risk to the health of consumers.
Fish and shellfish from Navotas, Manila, Paran?aque, and Las Piñas also yielded negative for contamination based on testing conducted on Jul. 31, Aug. 6, and Aug. 12.
BFAR said it will continue to conduct fish sampling, sensory evaluation, and PAH testing in affected areas to track the effects of the oil spill.
It also urged fisherfolk and the general public to remain calm and monitor the situation through updates issued by government authorities —Jiselle Anne Casucian/AOL, GMA Integrated News

In a bulletin issued on Sunday evening, the UP MSI said its forecast, with the help of concerned government agencies, was based on the weather patterns and conditions including wind direction.
“The model shows possible transport northwards to Bulacan confirmed by oil slick sightings, from the slick observed on July 26, 2024 5:40AM by [the Philippine Space Agency],” the UP MSI said.
“Considering the continuous release of oil from the tanker, coastal areas of Cavite City may also be affected with the eastward change of forecasted winds today, July 28, 2024,” it added.
However, the UP MSI noted that models should be used with caution as they have some levels of uncertainty due to assumptions and limitations.
The UP MSI said models are produced to inform the public on the potential direction of the oil spill and help direct response measures on the ground.
The Philippine Space Agency (PhilSA) released a map on Friday showing the potential size of the oil spill from the sunken tanker off the coast of Bataan.
It includes the tanker's location as well as a satellite image of the oil leak that was taken at 5:40 a.m., PhilSA said, adding that the slick covers an area of 14.4 square kilometers.
President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. on Saturday conducted an aerial inspection of the oil spill from the sunken MT Terranova and ordered the creation of an inter-agency task force that would address the matter.
On July 25, one crew member died and 16 others were rescued after MT Terranova capsized and sank 3.6 nautical miles east off Lamao Point in Limay town, the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) said.
The PCG on Sunday confirmed that there were leaks from the tanks carrying 1.4 million liters of industrial fuel oil onboard the motor tanker.

Bataan Governor Jose Garcia claimed the ship will be easily located as it sank in a shallow part of the Manila Bay.“Ang lalim na ating Manila Bay ay 30 meters so hindi imposible na magawan ng paraan para safely, securely mailabas yung laman ng tanker na langis para hindi makaapekto sa ating kapaligiran,” said Garcia in a Saksi report by Raffy Tima on Thursday.(The depth of Manila Bay is 30 meters so it’s not impossible to find a way to safely, securely retrieve the oil contained inside the tanker so that it would not affect the environment)Meanwhile, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. urged concerned agencies to assist and analyze the extent of the impact of the oil spill.“Basically, what we need to assess is where was the capsized vessel? The fuel is being released, what are the tides? What are the winds? Where is it headed? Para maunahan na natin. [The Department of Science and Technology] can also make some determinations of that,” he said.Department of Environment and Natural Resources Secretary Maria Antonia Yulo-Loyzaga also said that they will place a monitoring instrument as soon as the vessel has been located.“Kailangan pong malaman kung saan siya ngayon at kung ano ang estado ng istruktura ng barko and then andito kami para tumulong,” she said.(We just need to know where it is and what is the state of the structure of the vessel, and we are here to help) 
Oil trace
According to Balilo, the oil that was traced was probably the working fuel of the motor tanker and not part of the 1.4 million liters of industrial fuel stored in it.
“Probably ito yung fuel na ginagamit ng barko. Yung karga, wala pang signs na tumatagas na,” he told reporters in a virtual interview.
(This was probably the working fuel used of the ship. There are no signs that the industrial oil on storage is leaking yet.)
“Yun ang magiging goal natin na malaman kung tatagas based doon sa plan ng barko. Malalaman natin kung gaano ka-secure yung water integrity ng mga tanks niya,” he added.
(That will be our goal, to know if there will be a leak based on the ship's plan. We will know secure the tank is.)
The PCG said that ""there was no weather disturbance in the vicinity waters when the maritime incident occurred.""
PCG’s BRP Melchora Aquino launched search and rescue operations for the one missing crew.
“PCG Commandant, CG Admiral Ronnie Gil L Gavan, has ordered the conduct of an investigation regarding the maritime incident,” the PCG said.
The PCG is now coordinating with oil spill response organizations to help contain the spill.
The agency aims to retrieve the remaining oil inside the tanker in a span of seven days.
Huge waves
Balilo said that based on the initial account of rescued crew members huge waves hit and filled the motor tanker. 
“Umalis sila doon sa Bataan papunta ng Iloilo. Pero during that time bandang mga alas 10 ng gabi, naramdaman na nila na malakas na yung alon,” he told reporters.
(They departed Bataan for Iloilo. But  around 10 o'clock in the evening, they felt that the waves were getting stronger.)

AFP journalists at the Port of Limay in Bataan province watched Coast Guard personnel preparing equipment for a boat to be used against the slick in Manila Bay.
The MT Terra Nova sank in rough seas nearly seven kilometers (4.3 miles) off Limay municipality early Thursday after setting out for the central city of Iloilo.
An oil slick stretching several kilometers has been detected in the waterway, which thousands of fishermen and tourism operators rely on for their livelihoods.
But Coast Guard spokesman Rear Admiral Armando Balilo told a briefing Thursday that it appeared diesel fuel used to power the tanker had leaked and, so far, not the industrial fuel oil cargo.
The Coast Guard has set a target of seven days to offload the cargo and prevent what Balilo warned would be the worst oil spill in Philippine history if it were to leak.
The incident happened as heavy rains fueled by Super Typhoon Carina and the seasonal monsoon lashed Manila and surrounding regions in recent days.
Swamped by waves
After setting out late Wednesday the captain decided to abort the journey to Iloilo due to rough seas, but as the vessel turned back it was swamped by large waves and went down.
One crew member died, but 16 were rescued.
An investigation into the cause of the incident was underway but Balilo said Thursday the vessel had not broken rules on heavy-weather sailing.
Campaign group Greenpeace said the owners of MT Terra Nova should ""foot the bill"" for any environmental damage and compensate affected communities.
One of the worst oil spills in the Philippines was in February 2023, when a tanker carrying 800,000 liters of industrial fuel oil sank off the central island of Mindoro.
Diesel fuel and thick oil from that vessel contaminated the waters and beaches along the coast of Oriental Mindoro province, devastating the fishing and tourism industries.
The oil dispersed over hundreds of kilometers of waters famed for having some of the most diverse marine life in the world.
A tanker sank off the central island of Guimaras in 2006, spilling tens of thousands of gallons of oil that destroyed a marine reserve, ruined local fishing grounds and covered stretches of coastline in black sludge.
Immediate action sought
Meanwhile, fishers’ group Pambansang Lakas ng Kilusang Mamamalakaya ng Pilipinas (PAMALAKAYA) raised alarm over the incident and urged for the “immediate and appropriate measures” to contain the oil spill and its possible impact. 
“We are highly alarmed that this maritime incident could cause a massive oil spill in Manila Bay, affecting both the marine environment and socio-economic activities of fisherfolk… We can’t afford another ecological disaster if this oil spill escalates across our fishing grounds,” said PAMALAKAYA Vice Chairperson  Ronnel Arambulo said in a statement.
“We demand immediate and appropriate measures to contain this looming ecological disaster. The government should have a contingency plan for the potential impacts of the oil spill to marine and fishery resources,” Arambulo added. 
Arambulo said the oil spill should be prevented from reaching the 7.5-hectare fish sanctuary located in a coastal village in Limay, Bataan. It is also said the owner of MT Terra Nova should pay compensatory damages and shoulder the cleanup costs of the oil spill.  — with Sundy Mae Locus/Agence France-Presse

“There are so many red flags dito [in this incident],” DOJ Undersecretary Raul Vasquez said at the Saturday News Forum in Quezon City.
On Friday, Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla said the DOJ is eyeing the filing of a class suit against those responsible for the oil spill.
Remulla also said that all three vessels were “interconnected,” but did not elaborate.
Pressed to explain what the Justice chief meant when he said that the vessels involved in the incident were interconnected, Vasquez said, “‘Yan ang sinasabi kong red flag, pare-parehas na magkakadikit (That’s the red flag I’ve been talking about, they are all near each other).”
On July 25, the MT Terranova capsized and sank 3.6 nautical miles east off Lamao Point in Limay, Bataan, with one crew member reported to have died.
MT Terranova was carrying 1.4 million liters of industrial fuel.
Meanwhile, the MTKR Jason Bradley — another vessel that sank in the waters off Mariveles, Bataan on July 27 — was carrying 5,500 liters of diesel, and was also found to have leaks.
A third vessel, the MV Mirola 1, meanwhile, ran aground near the shore of Mariveles town. Oil was seen flowing into the ocean from tanks inside the motor vessel.
“I think, these are three to five nautical miles away from each other. We can draw a lot of conclusions from there,” Vasquez said.
Conspiracy?
Authorities are also questioning why the vessels sailed despite warnings of an upcoming typhoon, according to the DOJ official.
“Maraming mga question pero ayoko pa sabihin sa ngayon kasi ongoing pa ang fact-finding… Maybe it’s conspiracy, maybe… who knows?” Vasquez said.
Asked if the DOJ is looking at the angle of conspiracy in its ongoing investigation, he said, “Titignan natin malamang… kasi makikita mo may mga red flags (We'll look into it, of course… because there are red flags).”
GMA News Online has sought comment from the lawyer of Portvaga Ship Management Inc., which owns MV Terranova, but it has yet to reply as of posting time.
Meanwhile, Vasquez said the “admissions” from the crew of the involved vessels were also found to be red flags.
He questioned the number of hours that a certain vessel is at sea when its destination is much farther away.
“Nung nagtatanong kami… sinabi na ganito lang ‘yung nalayag niya, ilang oras na siya. Bakit? Papunta siyang Iloilo eh, bakit ganun lang? (When we asked… they said they've been out at sea for quite some time already and yet the ship has not moved that much.),” Vasquez said.
Intentional?
The DOJ official was also asked if the sinking of the vessels were intentional.
Vasquez responded, “Siguro, sa lahat naman ng investigation, we always look at the possibility na sinadya kasi mas mabigat ang liabilities eh (In all investigations, we always look at the possibility that it was intentional because the liabilities are heavier.)”
“Kahit hindi sinadya ‘yan, still it could be a crime, ‘yung criminal negligence na tinatawag (Even if it wasn't intentional, there could still be criminal liabiility),” he said.
Nonetheless, the DOJ official said that “under presumption of innocence, we cannot make any conclusions at this point.
Vasquez said the DOJ tasked the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) to conduct parallel investigation into the incident. –VAL, GMA Integrated News

“As of today, 05 August 2024, the PCG recovered 790 liters of oil-water mixture and five sacks of contaminated oil debris using absorbent pads,” the PCG said in an update.
The PCG continues to conduct oil recovery and containment operations. It also monitors the oil spill booms in the concerned area.
On Thursday, oil recovery operations started for MV Mirola 1, which ran aground in the vicinity waters of Sitio Quiapo, Barangay Biaan, Mariveles, Bataan on July 31.
Aside from MV Mirola 1, the PCG is also responding to the oil spill from MTKR Terranova with 1.4 million liters of industrial fuel oil and MTKR Jason Bradley with 5,500 liters of diesel.
Initial cappings have sealed the valves of MTKR Terranova but presence of very thin oil sheens were still observed in the ground zero, according to PCG.
Oil spill booms are still being repositioned and maintained to control the leak, the PCG added.
On July 25, one crew member died and 16 others were rescued after MTKR Terranova capsized and sank 3.6 nautical miles east off Lamao Point in Limay, Bataan, according to the PCG.
The initial capping bags on the valves of the motor tanker will be replaced with metal caps to avoid a “disastrous oil spill” during the conduct of the siphoning operation.
According to the PCG, the fabrication of metal cappings will take seven days and their installation will take another seven days. 
“This week, the earlier attached seals made of special canvass capping bags will be replaced with a new set to avoid undue risks from wear and tear from its exposure to oil,” the PCG commandant Admiral Ronnie Gil Gavan said.
After the replacement with metal cappings, the siphoning operation may start.
Of the 1.4 million liters of industrial fuel oil, 300,000 liters need to be siphoned to float MTKR Terranova. This would take up to seven days, the PCG said. The motor tanker will then be moved to a shallow area.
Meanwhile, the PCG and contracted salvor FES Challenger Salvour and Builders continue with their salvage operations for MTKR Jason Bradley.
Divers prepare for pipe insertion by clearing debris.
Equipment and personnel are being prepared on the site and an operational base is being set up, according to the PCG.
On July 27, MTKR Jason Bradley sank in the vicinity waters of Barangay Cabcaben, Mariveles, Bataan.
The estimated cost of damage due to the oil spill that is affecting the areas of Cavite has reached P1 billion, according to the provincial government on Saturday.
A state of calamity was declared in nine coastal local government units in Cavite due to the oil spill incident from sunken motor tanker Terranova in Bataan, according to the Office Civil Defense Calabarzon.

Marine protection organization Oceana raised the alarm on the spill's harmful impact on the municipal waters of Limay and Mariveles in Bataan, and Tanza, Rosario, Noveleta, and Cavite City in Cavite. 
“The government should  immediately assess the effects of the oil spill on the marine environment, including fisheries, ensure that procedures and standards are set in motion and  investigate who are directly responsible for this maritime incident,” said Oceana vice president Estenzo Ramos in a statement. 
“Further, we need to make sure that laws are strictly enforced and  appropriate penalties are implemented,” she added. “Learning from the lessons of the oil spill in the Verde Island Passage, we need to study and craft measures such as  increasing the fines and other sanctions  based on the damages caused on the habitats, wildlife  and the people’s lives and livelihood.” 
One died after MT Terra Nova, which was en route to Iloilo from Bataan, capsized 3.6 nautical miles east off Lamao Point in Limay town around 1:10 a.m.
An oil spill was also monitored 5.6 nautical miles east off Lamao Point with an estimated coverage of two nautical miles, carried by a strong current heading east to northeast. 
Meanwhile, Greenpeace urged the government to  lessen its dependence on fossil fuels as the oil spill is like a “ticking time bomb” to the safety and livelihoods of those living in coastal areas. 
“We reiterate our call for the Marcos administration to end our dependence on fossil fuels, and expedite a just transition to renewable energy,” said Greenpeace in a statement. 
“President Marcos must also call for payment from fossil fuel companies for losses and damages suffered by Filipino communities, and immediately adopt a comprehensive Climate Justice Agenda as the country faces the worsening impacts of the climate crisis.” 
According to the Philippine Coast Guard, Oil Spill Response Organizations, oil companies, and local government units offered to extend help in oil spill response efforts. 
The last major oil spill incident in the Philippines was just in February 2023 when the MT Princess Empress, which was carrying 900,000 liters of industrial oil, sank off the coast of Naujan, Oriental Mindoro. 
The oil spill recovery operations were finished in June of the same year. — Vince Angelo Ferreras/BM, GMA Integrated News

“Iyong technology kailangan pa nating i-improve kasi nga po may mga limitasyon, kasi nga iba-ibang klase ng oil,” said Hernando Bacosa, a professor at the Mindanao State University-Iligan Institute of Technology and the Department of Science and Technology's lead expert on oil spill, in a public briefing.
(We need to improve our technology because it has limitations in responding to different types of oil.)
Bacosa was referring to foam technology CocoFlexSorb, which is said to have the ability to absorb different types of oils, such as light, vegetable, kerosene, engine, and bunker oil.
However, the DOST said further testing and development needed to be done before the technology, developed by researchers from MSU-IIT, could be adopted and commercialized. 
“I think kailangan pa rin nating mag-develop noong mga material na gawa sa Pilipinas na magagamit natin kapag may darating na naman na oil spill,” he added.
(We need to develop materials that are made in the Philippines that can be used in future oil spill incidents.)
The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, meanwhile, lists oil spill booms and skimmers as two of the means used to contain oil spills.
Three vessels have been reported to be leaking environmentally harmful material off Bataan.
A motor vessel (MV) ran aground near the shore of Mariveles town on Wednesday.
Authorities discovered that oil from the tanks of MV Mirola 1 was spilling into the sea.
Three days prior, motor tanker (MT) Jason Bradley was discovered leaking diesel off the town's coast.
On July 25, a tanker sank off Limay town in Bataan amid heavy rains and rough seas, causing another oil spill.
The Philippine Coast Guard’s (PCG) salvage team was able to control the leakage of 1.4 million liters of industrial oil from the sunken MT Terranova. 
According to Bacosa, the oil spill in Limay is easier to manage because MT Terranova is only 30 meters deep, as opposed to MT Princess Empress, which was found 400 meters deep in Oriental Mindoro in 2023.“Ngayon it is under control, but still, nandun pa yung barko. Hanggat di natatanggal ang langis dun, meron pa rin threat sa ating environment. Dapat matanggal, siphone lahat ng langis,” Bacosa said.
(The vessel remains, but the oil slick is now under control. The threat to our environment remains because of the oil. You need to siphon off the oil.)The provincial government of Cavite has declared a state of calamity in eight towns affected by the oil spill from MT Terranova. —Mariel Celine Serquiña/VBL, GMA Integrated News

“Ngayon ay kinakonsolidate natin ang mahalagang information, mga datos ng mga barko nito kasama ang kanilang crew na i-interview din natin,” he said.
(Now we are consolidating important information, data and conducting interviews with the crew members.)
The owner of MT Terranova, one of the ships that sank, already denied allegations that the tanker was involved in oil smuggling.
“The owners of MTKr Terranova, categorically deny the allegations of smuggling and involvement in ‘paihi’ operations,” the Porta Vaga Ship Management Group said in a statement.

In a statement, the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) said it is set to release fuel subsidies and additional food packs to affected fishers.
“As a safety measure, the Bureau advises against consuming fishes caught in areas where oil slicks have been observed,” the BFAR said.
“This is to avoid incidents of food poisoning as a result of ingesting contaminated seafood. DA-BFAR, likewise, urges fisherfolk and the general public to remain calm and monitor the situation through updates issued by government authorities,” it added. --VAL, GMA Integrated News

PCG National Capital Region (NCR)-Central Luzon spokesperson Lieutenant Commander Michael John Encina said that their investigating team is identifying the real reason why the sunken MT Terranova, the MTKR Jason Bradley and MV Mirola were in waters off Bataan before the incidents happened.
Under the “paihi” system, oil from a large vessel is transferred to smaller crafts at sea to avoid paying taxes.
“Ang mga ganitong reports ay hindi namin dini-discount. We are carefully coordinating din po sa other agencies para tulungan tayo sa previous citations ng mga barkong ito,” Encina said in a Super Radyo dzBB interview.
(We do not discount such reports. We are also carefully coordinating with other agencies to help us know what are the previous citations of these ships.)

In an advisory, the DOH emphasized that oil spill may cause the following health effects depending on how an individual came in contact with the substance: 
To avoid these, the DOH advised that warning signs be put up in affected areas or near affected bodies of water. The public should also ensure that their drinking water and food are clean.
Children should also be prohibited from affected areas, as they usually play on the ground and are at higher risk of ingestion since they frequently put their hands in their mouths.
The DOH said when exposed to the oil spill or any chemical from the oil spill, the clothes should be removed and decontaminated. Exposed areas of the body should also be immediately washed with mild soap and water.
Those experiencing any symptoms from exposure to oil spill are urged to seek immediate medical assistance from the nearest health facility and healthcare professional. 
The DOH also reminded the public not to bathe, wash clothes, or wade in oil spill affected areas to avoid exposure to the oil and any chemicals used to control the spill. 
Even pets and farm animals should be barred from bathing or drinking from the affected water. 
The agency also asked the public not to eat seafood like fish and shellfish from affected areas and nearby water sources unless cleared by local authorities.
