Public Hearing/Inquiry, In Aid of Legislation On the Oil Spill From M/T Terra Nova In Limay, Bataan",2024-09-17T10:15:26+08:00,"Again, good morning everyone.

This is the Committee's second hearing on Proposed Senate Resolution No. 1084 directing this Committee to conduct an inquiry, in aid of legislation, on the oil spill from M/T Terra Nova in Limay, Bataan on July 25, 2024, which is detrimental to the marine ecosystem, biodiversity, health, food security, and livelihood of the people in affected areas, filed by Senator Francis ""Tol"" N. Tolentino. Related to this incident is the capsizing of MT Jason Bradley and MV Mirola 1. Subpoenas were issued to the owners of M/Tkr Jason Bradley, Mr. Romnick Ponestas, and MV Mirola 1, Ms. Mary Jane Ubaldo, to require their presence in today's hearing.

To recap, during our first public hearing held a month ago on August 14, 2024, the Committee asked to be enlightened as to the cause of the oil spill. Commandant Admiral Gavan and Captain Marfil gave an overview on the incident and their strategies. MARINA, through Administrator Malaluan, gave a report on MT Terranova's vessel documents, and the actions that MARINA has taken. Both PCG and MARINA could not explain in detail the cause of the incident because their joint investigation was still on-going then and would take six months to complete. However, they committed to submit to the Committee a preliminary report for today's hearing.

On other hand, NBI, who was conducting a parallel investigation, has committed to submit a progress report within two weeks.

In addition, the Committee also asked about the impact of the oil spill and the relief efforts to the communities greatly affected. In response:

1. The DENR, through Secretary Loyzaga, and the EMB, through Director Caancan, reported on their incident command system, water quality and air quality assessment, biodiversity management, and initial mitigation measures, which include the placement of oil spill booms.

2. The DA-BFAR, though Assistant Director Atty. Encarnacion, reported on the effects of the oil spill on the fisheries based on sensory evaluation.

3. The DOLE, through Secretary Laguesma, reported on the assistance given to residents affected by the oil spill through its emergency employment program or the Tulong Panghanapbuhay sa Ating Disadvantaged Workers (TUPAD) program in Bataan, Cavite, Bulacan, Pampanga, and Tarlac.

4. The DSWD, through Undersecretary Cajipe, reported on the progress of its distribution of family food packs and financial assistance in Bataan and Cavite.

5. The DOTr, through Undersecretary Sarmiento, explained about the Oil Tanker Pollution Coordination Committee, where all claims relative to oil pollution damage under Republic Act 9843, or the Oil Compensation Act shall be coordinated.

7. The DND-OCD, through Director Idio, manifested that it ensures the application of the whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach in addressing concerns, not only for the oil spill incident, but also for other disasters.

8. The DOJ, through Atty. Ganchoon, discussed the sufficiency of the existing legal framework with respect to compensation for oil pollution damage.

9. OCEANA, through Atty. Gloria Ramos, manifested the need for better coordination and transparency among government agencies to prevent incidents like this from happening again, and emphasized a fossil-free future, and

10. Greenpeace, through Mr. Chua, pointed out the need to strengthen accountability mechanisms to hold polluters liable, and raised concerns on the rolling out of compensation for affected communities in Oriental Mindoro.

The owner of MT Terranova and its management, through Atty. Del Rosario, likewise assured that they will compensate the damage to the livelihood of fisherfolks and the communities affected. For this purpose, they have been coordinating with the LGUs for the creation of the claim centers.

During the course of the hearing, the following documents were asked to be submitted:

1. From the PCG and MARINA:

- Its joint safety investigation report.

2. From MARINA:

- Copies of the show cause orders against the owner, the ship manager, master mariner, and classification society.

3. From the NBI:

- Its investigation report.

4. From the DENR:

- The list of facilities transporting or treating hazardous waste products or oil debris.

5. From the DOTR:

- Its report on the processing of claims and the amounts of claim during the Mindoro oil spill.

6. From the DA-BFAR:

- Its sensory evaluation reports in connection with the fish and shellfish samples.

7. From Atty. Del Rosario of Porta Vaga Ship Management Inc.:

- Its registration papers of the following vessels:

a) MT Terra Nova,

b) MT Leola Micaela,

c) MT Aleya Louis,

d) MT Alysa Isabel,

e) MT Helen Marie, and

f) MT Melissa Rae.

- A report on the comparison of the claims or settlement during the Mindoro and Bataan oil spill, and

- A write-up on the ""current buster"" device.

This Committee notes your submission and will provide the members copies thereof.

Again, the oil spill has caused extensive economic and environmental damage, posing threats to marine ecosystem and biodiversity, and the livelihood of fisherfolks and coastal communities. We echo Senator Tol's sentiment that this is result of the government's neglect, which causes misery to our fisherfolks, and which needs to be properly addressed. Thus, as we begin this hearing, the Committee reiterates its objectives: to determine the cause of the oil spill, address its impact, assess the effectiveness and sufficiency of the response efforts, and illicit the truth to the oil smuggling allegations.

Thank you and I would like to hear the results of the investigation of PCG, MARINA, and the NBI.

Pursuant to Republic Act No. 9483, also known as the Oil Pollution Compensation Act of 2007, a quick response fund and a committee were established to manage and oversee the use of resources for such incidents.

 

Energy Secretary Raphael P.M. Lotilla has also requested private oil companies and related businesses to provide full support in efforts to contain the oil spill and assist affected communities.

 

“In compliance with the President's directive for government agencies to extend assistance and to jointly evaluate the environmental impact of the oil spill, we are actively collaborating and giving full support to the Department of Transportation (DOTr), Philippine Coast Guard (PCG), Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), Department of Science and Technology (DOST), the local government of Bataan, and other involved agencies in response operations and hazard mitigation efforts related to this incident,” said Secretary Lotilla.

 

Preliminary information indicates that the MT Terra Nova, carrying 1.4 million liters of industrial fuel oil, was en route to Iloilo, Panay, when the incident occurred approximately 3.5 nautical miles off the coast of Lamao, a barangay in Limay, Bataan. Industrial fuel oil is primarily used in power plants and large manufacturing industries."

Tolentino earlier filed a resolution to investigate the cause of the oil spill that affected around 46,000 fisherfolk, marine biodiversity, and food security in Bataan, Cavite, Metro Manila, and nearby areas.

“We need to set up stricter mechanisms to prevent such incidents, and to improve our capability to immediately respond to contain, clean up, and mitigate the impact of this toxic substance on the fishing sector and the environment,” Tolentino said in a news release, citing similar occurrences in Pola, Oriental Mindoro in 2023, and the island-province of Guimaras in 2006.

Tolentino also urged the Department of Agriculture (DA) to collaborate with other agencies to support fish vendors who are affected by the lower catch and subsequent fishing bans due to the oil spill.

""We must not forget the fish vendors. The government must also reach out to them because we have interviewed sellers in public markets who said that many stalls selling fish have now been closed,” the senator told DA Assistant Secretary Arnel De Mesa in his radio program.

In response, De Mesa assured the DA will work with the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) and the Department of Trade Industry (DTI) to assist fish vendors.

The Philippine Coast Guard is currently receiving assistance from the United States Coast Guard and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to contain the spill.

The DA, through the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR), has also started extending fuel subsidies to affected fisherfolk. (PNA)"

Tolentino filed Senate Resolution No. 1084, which directs the Senate Committee on Environment, Natural Resources, and Climate Change to conduct an inquiry, in aid of legislation, into the sea catastrophe.

""It is important to determine the cause of the oil spill, explore ways to mitigate its negative effects, and recommend policy measures to prevent similar incidents in the future,"" said the senator, who chairs the Special Committee on Maritime and Admiralty Zones.

""In Cavite, the oil spill has affected coastal areas in Bacoor, Kawit, Noveleta, Rosario, Tanza, Naic, Maragondon, and Ternate. There are fishing communities and tourist resorts there,"" Tolentino noted.

As of Wednesday (July 31), the province of Cavite has declared a State of Calamity and a No-Catch Zone for shellfish (tahong, alimasag, alimango, halaan) in the said localities.

In his resolution, Tolentino cited reports from the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) which said that the MT Terra Nova was carrying approximately 1.4 million liters of industrial oil when it capsized on July 25.

""The oil spill poses a serious threat to the marine ecosystem, coastal communities, and livelihood sources in the provinces of Bataan, Cavite, Nasugbu in Batangas, and Bulacan,"" the senator underscored.

Finally, Tolentino stressed the need for proactive measures to help affected communities, specifically the fisherfolk and tourism sector, and for a whole-of-government resolution to mitigate the adverse effects of the oil spill."

The 65-meter vessel was carrying nearly 1.5 million litres of industrial fuel, according to official reports. The incident occurred 3.6 nautical miles off the coast of Limay in Bataan, an area well-known for its fishing industry, raising concerns about the potential impact on both marine life and local livelihoods.

In response, the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) swiftly deployed floating barriers and initiated oil spill clean-up efforts to prevent the spill from reaching Manila’s coastline.

To coordinate with various PCG units and other agencies, the PCG utilised, among other means, IORIS, the communication, cooperation, and collaboration platform developed by CRIMARIO, which is now used by over 100 navies, authorities, and agencies across more than 50 countries in the Indo-Pacific.

By September 12, the emergency was declared over, following the PCG’s final inspection at the site of the sunken vessel in Limay, Bataan. The activity was led by Marine Environmental Protection Command (MEPCOM) Commander, Vice Admiral Roy Echeverria. Harbor Star, the contracted salvage company, reported that they recovered 1,415,954 litres of oil along with 17,725 kilograms of solid oily waste, achieving a recovery rate of 97.43%

Since signing the IORIS Partnership Agreement (IPA) in Sep 2023, the PCG has progressively transitioned to a more integrated approach in coordinating joint operations, using IORIS  between its districts and stations and across multiple agencies. This  collaborative approach has been key in tackling maritime challenges

The use of real-time, encrypted communication through IORIS has enhanced the PCG’s response time and operational efficiency, particularly in managing MARPOL situations  like this one, significantly improving their ability to jointly protect both the environment and the fishing resources."
5,https://www.rappler.com/philippines/owner-mt-terranova-taps-harbor-star-salvage-tanker-clean-oil-spill/,"Owner of MT Terranova taps Harbor Star to salvage tanker, help in oil spill cleanup",2024-07-29T13:25:27+08:00,"MANILA, Philippines – Shogun Ships Company Incorporated (SSCI), owner of MT Terranova, tapped publicly-listed Philippine company Harbor Star Shipping Services to salvage the tanker carrying 1.4 million liters of industrial fuel oil which sank on Thursday, July 25, off Bataan province near Manila Bay.

The no-cure, no-pay contract between both parties includes oil spill response operations to minimize possible environmental damage, Harbor Star told the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) on Friday, July 26. The maritime services provider immediately sent its tugboats and salvage equipment to Bataan.

A no-cure, no pay contract means that Harbor Star will not be paid if it is unable to fulfill the terms of the agreement. The Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) reported that MT Terranova capsized and eventually submerged at 1:10 am on Thursday, around 3.6 nautical miles or around seven kilometers east off Lamao Point in Limay, Bataan. Sixteen crew members were rescued while the body of the last missing crew member was located by BRP Melchora Aquino later in the afternoon.

The maritime incident happened even though the weather disturbance from the southwest monsoon or habagat had already weakened on Thursday.

Harbor Star was one of the companies tapped in last year’s Mindoro oil spill, after MT Princess Empress sank on February 23, 2023 off the coast of Naujan, Oriental Mindoro. Similar to this new incident, MT Princess Empress left Limay, Bataan with 900,000 liters of industrial fuel oil. It was owned by Reield Marine Services and was chartered by a San Miguel shipping subsidiary to transport the black oil to Iloilo.

Limay Mayor Nelson David told Radyo 360 on Friday that around 400 to 500 liters of the vessel’s engine fuel leaked. There are no reports yet if the industrial fuel oil it was carrying was already spilling, as of writing.

The Department of Environment and Natural Resources has deployed its survey vessel BRG Hydrographer Presbitero to locate the sunken ship.

PCG also deployed three 44-meter multi-role response vessels for the oil spill response operations.

“These vessels will start the application of oil dispersants to immediately mitigate impact, especially during the period where siphoning is being prepared,” said PCG Commandant Ronnie Gil Gavan on Thursday.

According to Gavan, the PCG hopes to finish siphoning operations in seven days.

“The vessel sunk 34 meters deep which is considerably shallow. Siphoning will not be very technical and can be done quickly to protect the vicinity waters of Bataan and Manila Bay against environmental, social, economic, financial, and political impacts,” said PCG spokesperson Rear Admiral Armando Balilo.

However, the spokesperson said they are still preparing for the worst-case scenario. At 1 pm Friday, PCG officials met with representatives from SSCI and salvor Harbor Star to discuss the timeline of siphoning operations.

“Walang dapat ipag-alala, pero hindi kami nagpapakampante,” Balilo said. (There’s nothing to worry about, but we will not be complacent.)

In the worst-case scenario, vicinity waters of Parañaque, Manila, Navotas, Bulacan, and Pampanga would be affected.

“We are utilizing our manpower, mobilizing our resources, consulting with experts, and collaborating with LGUs and other stakeholders to avoid a marine environment catastrophe,” said Balilo.

Balilo also clarified there was no public storm warning signal raised over Bataan when MT Terranova set sail.

Currently, the PCG is conducting a joint marine casualty investigation with the Maritime Industry Authority.

The Philippines’ largest oil firm Petron Corporation has volunteered to help in the oil spill response. Petron, part of the San Miguel Group of companies, operates a refinery in Limay.

Groups have called on the government and the shipowner to control the spread of the oil spill to prevent harm to the environment and coastal communities.


“The owners of MT Terranova and its cargo must come forward and claim responsibility: foot the bill for any environmental damage this may cause, and provide compensation to the communities affected,” said Jefferson Chua, climate campaigner for Greenpeace.

“The government must also ensure that the full weight of our legal system is applied to ensuring justice for the people of Limay and the other communities in the area,” Chua added.

International organization Oceana stressed the implementation of the recently passed Philippine Ecosystem and Natural Cost Accounting System (PENCAS) law to estimate the cost incurred from the maritime disaster.

“All those responsible for failing to prevent this tragedy – from concerned government agencies to private owners of the tanker – should be held accountable,” said Gloria Estenzo Ramos, vice president of Oceana.

“Considering the oil spills’ destructive impacts on our fishing grounds and habitats, not to mention that majority of our population rely on a healthy and productive marine ecosystems for sustenance, it is time to impose even higher penalties and stricter accountability measures and implement the PENCAS law,” added Ramos.

Villar, presiding over the hearing of the Committee on Environment, Natural Resources, and Climate Change yesterday, said the owners and operators of MTKR Terranova, MV Mirola 1, and MT Jason Bradley which sunk last July off the coast of Bataan, should be made accountable for the devastating oil spill.

""Again, the oil spill has caused extensive economic and environmental damage, posing threats to marine ecosystem and biodiversity, and the livelihood of fisherfolks and coastal communities,"" Villar said.

During the hearing, Martin Jose Despi, regional director, Environmental Management Bureau, Region III; Commodore Arnaldo Lim, Philippine Coast Guard; and Sonia Malaluan, administrator, Maritime Industry Authority, gave their commitment that they will file charges within a month's time.

Public Hearing/Inquiry, In Aid of Legislation
On the Oil Spill From M/T Terra Nova
In Limay, Bataan",2024-08-14T10:17:45+08:00,"Our agenda at today's public hearing centers on Proposed Senate Resolution No. 1084 filed by Senator Francis ""Tol"" Tolentino. This resolution directs our Committee to conduct an inquiry, in aid of legislation, on the oil spill from M/T Terra Nova in Limay, Bataan. It seeks to address the severe impact of the incident on our marine ecosystem, biodiversity, and the livelihood and health of the affected communities.

As background, on July 25, 2024, M/T Terra Nova, a 22-year-old Philippine-registered vessel carrying 1.4 million liters of industrial fuel oil, capsized off the coast of Limay, Bataan. The sinking occurred during the time when Typhoon Carina had already weakened. As a result of the spill, thousands of liters of oil have leaked into Manila Bay, with the spill reported to have stretched across 12 to 14 kilometers.

Adding to the gravity of the situation, two other ships also sank within the waters of Bataan shortly after the M/T Terra Nova incident. On July 26, 2024, the tanker M/T Jason Bradley capsized due to bad weather conditions in Mariveles, Bataan, and on July 31, 2024, the motor vessel M/V Mirola 1 ran aground on the coast of Mariveles. The sinking of these vessels raises additional concerns about maritime safety and environmental protection across the affected areas.

This incident is a significant setback to the ongoing efforts to clean-up Manila Bay to comply with the Supreme Court's long-standing continuing mandamus to clean up, rehabilitate, and preserve Manila Bay, and to restore and maintain its waters so they are fit for swimming, skin diving, and other forms of contact recreation. The oil spill incident is also an added impediment to our ongoing efforts to strengthen the ecosystem and restore our fragile biodiversity during this time as we undergo the United Nations Decade of Ecosystem Restoration (2021-2030). The repercussions are severe: the environmental damage is extensive, posing a serious threat to marine life and coastal ecosystems. Moreover, the livelihoods of thousands of fisherfolk and coastal communities have been severely disrupted, with estimated economic losses of about one billion pesos and counting. The affected areas in Bataan include the municipalities of Abucay, Limay, Mariveles, Orani, Orion, Samal, and the City of Balanga. Hagonoy in Bulacan is also affected. In Cavite, seven towns and two cities are impacted: the municipalities of Kawit, Noveleta, Rosario, Tanza, Naic, Maragondon, Ternate, and the cities of Cavite and Bacoor. As a result, states of calamity have been declared in these areas.

In addition to the environmental and economic concerns, there have been allegations that M/T Terra Nova was involved in oil smuggling activities, specifically ""paihi"" operations, where oil is illegally transferred to smaller vessels to evade taxes. The owners of M/T Terra Nova have publicly denied these accusations and asserted that the vessel was not involved in any illicit activities and that its operations have adhered to legal standards. Nonetheless, these allegations has added another layer of complexity to our inquiry.

As we begin this hearing, our primary objectives are: to determine and understand the impact of this incident, assess the effectiveness of the response efforts, and identify any gaps that need to be addressed. It is also essential to determine whether there is truth to the ""paihi"" allegations to ensure transparency and accountability. Additionally, we must consider long-term measures to prevent both oil spills as well as illicit activities like ""paihi"" from occurring in the future. Our responsibility today is to ensure those at fault, if any, are held accountable and to strengthen our laws and policies to better protect our environment and the communities that depend on it.

I look forward to engage in a productive discussion, keeping in mind the urgency of the situation and the need for immediate and decisive action.

Thank you."

Gatchalian made the statement following the sinking of MT Terra Nova, an oil tanker carrying 1.4 million liters of industrial fuel, off the coast of Bataan on July 25 amid heavy rains brought by the seasonal monsoon and Typhoon Carina. The tanker, with 17 crew members, was heading towards Iloilo when it sank.

""We need to leverage our manpower, mobilize all available resources, and collaborate closely with local government units,"" Gatchalian emphasized. He added that responding to natural disasters like these require a whole-of-government approach, which includes support from the Philippine Navy and the Department of Environment and Natural Resources.

The government needs to ensure that the ship's condition and onboard practices meet international safety standards, according to Gatchalian.

In the country, the Marine Environmental Protection Command (MEPCOM), a unit of the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG), is the point of contact for oil spill response operations and comprises the National Operations Center for Oil Pollution (NOCOP).

The PCG on Friday said it started collecting oil to counter the spread of the spill. On Monday, a group of fishermen said that the oil spill from the sunken oil tanker has already reached the shorelines of Tanza, Naic, Maragondon and Ternate in Cavite.

""It's good to know that the Philippine Coastguard promptly implemented precautionary measures, such as deploying oil spill booms in the area,"" Gatchalian said.

Just last year, MT Princess Empress sank off the coast of Naujan, Oriental Mindoro, causing an oil spill in the waters in Antique, Batangas, Oriental Mindoro, and even Palawan.

""Hindi na dapat paulit ulit ang oil spill na nangyayari sa bansa dahil matinding pinsala ang dulot nito hindi lang sa kalikasan kundi sa kabuhayan ng marami sa ating kababayan,"" he ended."
