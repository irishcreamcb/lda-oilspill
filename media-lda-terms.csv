The Bataan oil spill has affected the livelihood of fisherfolk in Manila Bay, specifically in Bataan and Cavite. Hectares of critical ecosystems were said to be potentially affected, too.
Representatives from the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources, Department of Environment and Natural Resources, Philippine Coast Guard (PCG), and the Maritime Industry Authority told Villar they would immediately work on filing cases, with varying targets from one to three months.
But the Department of Justice (DOJ) would have to ensure the strength of evidence, said Fretti Ganchoon, senior state counsel at the DOJ. Ganchoon specializes on international maritime law. 
“So, ibig mong sabihin, walang strength of evidence? Nakita mo na ‘yung oil spill, nakita mo na ‘yung di nakain ‘yung isda for ilang weeks, tapos ngayon, strength of evidence pa sasabihin mo sa akin?” Villar, who leads the Senate committee on environment, natural resources and climate change, said on Tuesday. This is the Senate’s second hearing into the oil spill incident that happened last July. 
(Do you mean to tell me there’s no strength of evidence when you already saw the oil spill, you saw how the fish were uneatable for weeks? Now, you’re using strength of evidence as an excuse?)
Ganchoon explained that the case buildup is a crucial part of filing, as insufficient evidence will only result in a dismissal of the case. She added that damage to livelihood and the environment can either be a civil or criminal case.
“Very technical po kasi ‘yung evidence in court,” Ganchoon said. “But dito po sa atin, we can say na, opo, may effect sa environment.“
(Evidence in court is very technical. But here we can say, yes, there is an effect on the environment.)
Meanwhile, Senator Francis Tolentino brought up the 2023 Oriental Mindoro oil spill and asked what cases had been filed. 
“Matagal-tagal na iyang Mindoro oil spill,” said Tolentino. (A long time has passed since the Mindoro oil spill.)
In this case, it was Pola, Oriental Mindoro Mayor Jennifer Cruz, together with the National Bureau of Investigation Environmental Crime Division, who filed a criminal complaint against the owner of sunken MT Princess Empress. It came three months after the ship sank off Naujan in February 2023. 
MT Terranova sank off Limay, Bataan, more than a month ago. Its sinking was conflated with MTKR Jason Bradley and MV Mirola 1, both of which ran into trouble in Bataan around the same time frame that MT Terranova sank.
The two other ships were plagued by anomalies. MTKR Jason Bradley had a warrant of seizure and detention for its alleged involvement in oil smuggling in 2022, while MV Mirola 1 set sail without clearance from the PCG.
Mary Jane Ubaldo, the owner of MV Mirola 1, recounted during Tuesday’s hearing the events that led to their ship sailing off in July without clearance from the Coast Guard.
Ubaldo said the caretaker of MV Mirola 1 — then anchored in the vicinity of the breakwater in Navotas — “panicked” when waters became rough The caretaker tried to seek safe harbor by asking help from a tugboat’s captain.
The shipowner said: “Habang hinihila na po sila nitong tugboat, naputol po ‘yung pagkakatali. Doon na po nag-umpisa mag-panic ‘yung caretaker ko po. Kasama po kasi niya ‘yung asawa po niya tsaka ‘yung anak niya. Tumalon po sila sa dagat, lumipat po doon sa tugboat. Tapos po, naiwan na po na napapadpad po ‘yung barko.“
(When it was being towed by the tugboat, the line was cut off. That’s when my caretaker started panicking, especially because he was with his wife and child. They jumped into the sea and transferred into the tugboat. Then, the ship was left floating away.)
Ubaldo denied being involved in an oil smuggling incident in the past year but said they had a similar violation of leaving the port without clearance before.
MV Mirola 1 ran aground in Mariveles, Bataan, days before MT Terranova sank. Two days after the MT Terranova incident, MTKR Jason Bradley sank off the waters of Barangay Cabcaben in Mariveles.
As of September 13, the Coast Guard reported that the siphoning of industrial oil from MT Terranova had been completed, with salvage operations to follow. – Rappler.com

1,https://www.rappler.com/philippines/luzon/bataan-coastal-community-pain-oil-spill-disasters/,Bataan coastal community still feels the pain of oil spill disasters,2024-09-17T14:15:46+08:00,"BATAAN, Philippines – Residents of Gatchalian in Cabcaben, Mariveles, Bataan once described their coastal life as abundant and peaceful. Their deep connection to the sea, which provided for their daily needs, was disrupted when oil spills tainted their once-pristine shores.
That tranquility ended on July 27 with the sinking of the MTKR Jason Bradley, which was carrying 5,500 liters of diesel. When Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) personnel arrived that day, they found the vessel abandoned with no crew members in sight.
“Noong araw na iyon, wala silang pupuntahan kundi sa dalampasigan ng Cabcaben at Mt. View. Ngunit, sad to say, wala tayong survivor. Parang inabandona ‘yung barko,” said Reynaldo Castro, barangay chairman of Cabcaben.
(On that day, there was nowhere else they could go except on the shores of Cabcaben and Mt. View. But sad to say, there were no survivors. It was like they abandoned the ship.)
The crisis in Bataan was compounded by a series of maritime disasters in this province. On July 25, the MT Terranova sank in Limay, releasing 100,000 liters of industrial oil into the sea. The MTKR Jason Bradley’s disaster followed soon after, and by July 31, the MV Mirola 1 added to the damage in Sitio Quiapo, Mariveles.
In response, Governor Joet Garcia declared a state of calamity to address the severe impact on 17,000 fishermen and over 15,000 families in Limay and Mariveles.
These oil spills have wreaked havoc on the local fishing industry, severely affecting the likes of 61-year-old Antonio Tagayong. Antonio has fished in Cabcaben for 37 years. He said their fishing trips were delayed for days because of Typhoon Carina before the oil spill occurred. Instead of finding relief after the typhoon, residents were met with a foul stench from their oil-covered shores.
“Dahil sa malalaking alon siguro. Malakas ang hangin. Kaya nalaman na lang namin kinabukasan ng umaga. Marami nang diesel at langis ang nakalutang,” Antonio recounted.
(Perhaps it was because of the big waves and strong wind. We just discovered the next morning there lots of diesel and oil floating.)
For six days after the spill, fishermen faced a fishing ban that left them unable to earn a living from the sea. With no alternative sources of income and struggling with poverty, they eventually resumed fishing in hopes of catching enough crabs to sustain their daily needs.
In response to the challenging situation, the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) provided 5,000 food packs to affected communities. These packs were distributed across twelve barangays in Mariveles, with the assistance of the Municipal Social Welfare and Development Office (MSWDO).
“Kasi wala nga naman silang pagkakakitaan, at wala pang binibigay na tulong mula sa pamahalaan. Kaya ang ginawa nila, lumaot na lang kahit papaano kumikita sila. Lalo na’t malapit na ang pasukan, wala silang ibang mapagkukunan,” he said.
(They did not have other jobs, and the government was not helping them. So what they did was head to the sea and hopefully be able to earn something. Specially now that its almost Christmas, they had to fine way to earn a living.)
Before the oil spill, Antonio earned about P500 pesos a day from selling crabs. Now, with sales plummeting, he struggles to make just P200 pesos. The decline in livelihoods for fishermen and vendors is partly due to health concerns over seafood from oil-affected waters. However, the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) reported on August 12 that fish and shellfish from Bataan, Bulacan, and Pampanga tested negative for oil contamination.
“Para bumaba ‘yung presyo, sasabihin ng namamakyaw sa’min na apektado ng oil spill, pero pagdating naman sa merkado, mahal nilang ibebenta. Nakakain naman namin mga huli namin,” he said.
(To lower the prices, the wholesalers say our catch was affected by the oil spill. But when they resell in the market, they markup the prices. We can actually eat our catch [it’s not contaminated].)
Jonathan Nuñez, 46, has faced similar struggles. He used to earn P2,000 pesos a day from fishing, but now his earnings have dropped to P500, with high fuel costs further cutting into his income.
“Lumaot na kami kahapon. Kaya lang, ‘yung mga isda ayaw pang kuhanin ng mga namimili at mga pumapakyaw ng isda,” he said.
(We went fishing yesterday. But the merchants and wholesalers still refuse to buy our catch.)
Months after the spill, fishermen like Antonio and Jonathan struggle with debt and reduced earnings. They are hoping to receive compensation for the damage to their livelihoods and that their pleas for justice will be heard by the authorities.
As of September 10, the Oil Spill Response Team (OSTR) reports that cleaning operations are ongoing in Cabcaben, with the salvor FES Challenger working on seawater extraction. The MTKR Jason Bradley was scheduled to be refloated on September 14, for further cleanup.
Even with these ongoing efforts, the local economy and the livelihoods of fishermen like Antonio and Jonathan are still deeply affected by the oil spill. They remain hopeful that their fortunes will improve and that they will recover from the losses they have endured. – Rappler.com

2,https://www.rappler.com/philippines/mt-terranova-oil-siphoning-ends-investigation-continues/,"MT Terranova siphoning operations end with 97% recovery rate, says salvor",2024-09-13T10:17:31+08:00,"MANILA, Philippines – The oil siphoning operations on the MT Terranova ended on Thursday, September 12, with a recovery rate of over 97%, its salvor reported to the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG)
In a report to the PCG, Harbor Star said the operations recovered 1,415,954 liters of oil and 17,725 kilograms of solid oil waste or a recovery rate of 97.43%.
Harbor Star said 37,867 liters or 2.57% of the oil cargo from MT Terranova were “lost due to various factors such as biodegradation, dissipation, absorption by sorbent booms, and unpumpable sludge left in the tanks.”
The PCG earlier said 55,512 liters were lost, but later corrected the figure to 37,867 liters.
After the recovery of oil, Harbor Star will conduct a stripping operation to make sure that cargo from oil tanks are completely removed. Salvage operations will commence once done.
The completion of the oil recovery operation comes more than a month after the MT Terranova sank off Limay, Bataan, while carrying 1.4 million liters of industrial fuel oil en route to Iloilo. 
The PCG conducted the final inspection of ground zero on Thursday. 
Meanwhile, investigation to hold concerned parties liable for the oil spill and two other incidents in Bataan — the sunken MTKR Jason Bradley and the MV Mirola 1 which ran aground — continues, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said on Thursday.
“Sa usapin naman ng imbestigasyon, tuloy-tuloy ang paghahanap natin ng sagot sa mga katanungang: May kinalaman ba ang mga barkong ito sa oil smuggling? Bakit ang dalawang barko, sa kabila ng walang rehistro ay napatakbo sa ating karagatan?” Marcos said during an aid distribution event in Navotas on Thursday, according to a Presidential Communications Office press statement.
“Lahat ito ay iniimbestigahan para tiyakin na pananagutin natin ang mga may sala,” he added.
(With regard to the investigation, we continue to looking for answers to these questions: Are these ships involved in oil smuggling? Why were the two ships, despite not being registered, able to set sail in our seas? All of this is being investigated to ensure that all those accountable are held liable.)
The two unregistered ships are the MTKR Jason Bradley and MV Mirola 1. The PCG said in its latest update that the salvor for MTKR Jason Bradley was still installing siphoning pipes to extract seawater, and aims to float the tanker by Saturday, September 14.
“It’s far from over,” fisherfolk group Pagkakaisa ng mga Samahan ng mga Mangingisda sa Pilipinas said on Wednesday, September 11. 
The group demanded that the government “quickly rehabilitate” marine resources and expand assistant not just to fisherfolk but to women engaged in maintenance of equipment and post-harvest operations. 
The Department of Justice had previously floated the possibility of the three tankers being involved in the “paihi” system, or oil smuggling. (READ: Red flags in Bataan? Remulla says billions lost due to oil smuggling)
“Paihi” literally means to urinate in Filipino, but has come to refer to an oil smuggling method where a larger tanker transfers oil to smaller tankers to evade taxes.

The announcement comes a month after the sinking of the tanker MT Terranova off Bataan last July 25 caused an oil spill.
Fish from Bacoor City, Cavite City, Noveleta, Rosario, and Tanza were still not fit for human consumption, the latest bulletin from the BFAR released a week ago or on August 22 said. 
Once fish from these areas pass another (or third) sensory evaluation, they will be deemed safe for consumption.
In the same bulletin, BFAR said fish from Naic, Ternate, Kawit, and Maragondon were safe to eat.

(DA Secretary Kiko Laurel just told me that you can resume fishing. There’s no oil spill anymore. You can now continue your livelihood.)
Marcos, together with Agriculture Secretary Francisco Tiu Laurel Jr., went to General Trias to distribute P363,050,000 worth of aid, according to a statement from the Presidential Communications Office.
Cavite province had announced a no-catch zone for shellfish a few days after MT Terranova sank and the oil spill reached the shores of its coastal towns.
Cavite Governor Jonvic Remulla said on Thursday, August 29, that fisherfolk can resume catching mussels and clams. 
Around 31,000 fishers and vendors from Cavite want compensation in light of the maritime disaster. (READ: Cavite fishers, vendors want P350 daily compensation from MT Terranova owner)
Oil siphoning from MT Terranova was still ongoing as of Thursday. The Philippine Coast Guard reported that salvor Harbor Star had collected 806,254 liters of oil and seawater from MT Terranova in a span of 10 days or nearly 60% of its oil cargo. 
Harbor Star said they have been siphoning oily waste from the vessel at 24,614 liters per hour.
MT Terranova sank off Limay, Bataan, on July 25. It was carrying 1.4 million liters of industrial fuel oil chartered by San Miguel Shipping subsidiary SL Harbor Bulk Terminal Corporation. 
The Coast Guard initially said the oil siphoning would only take a week since the sunken ship was just 34 meters under water. The President said on Wednesday the Coast Guard expects the siphoning to be completed in two weeks. 
MT Terranova’s sinking, alongside the cases of two other troubled vessels in Bataan, is being investigated by the Department of Justice and is the subject of congressional hearings. – Rappler.com

The siphoning operations are being conducted by Harbor Star Shipping Services, the company contracted by MT Terranova owner Shogun Ships to siphon the oil and salvage the ship.
According to the PCG, Harbor Star said the rate of oil flow as of Thursday was around 7,200 liters per hour, which would be equivalent to 172,800 liters per day. The PCG targets to extract 200,000 liters per day.
In the past week, the salvor had started to remove oil initially to determine the rate of oil flow. The plan is to remove all contaminants and float the tanker, before towing it to the shoreline.

Remulla says billions lost due to oil smuggling,2024-08-15T11:44:39+08:00,"MANILA, Philippines – With allegations of oil smuggling emerging after three vessels transporting petroleum ran into trouble off the waters of Bataan, Department of Justice (DOJ) Secretary Jesus Crispin “Boying” Remulla said the Philippines may be losing billions in revenue because of the “paihi” system.
“Paihi” literally means to urinate in Filipino, but has come to refer to an oil smuggling method where a larger tanker transfers oil to smaller tankers to evade taxes.
The justice secretary said the oil spill incident following the sinking of MT Terranova, MT Jason Bradley, and the running aground of MV Mirola 1 in Bataan had “opened another Pandora’s box about what’s happening in the Philippines that has been silently tolerated for the longest time.”
“[S]a aking tingin, pwedeng umabot ito ng daang bilyon na nawawala sa atin dahil sa mga sindikato na nananaig sa paihi ng fuel,” said Remulla in a press conference on Wednesday, August 14.
(In my view, what we lose because of oil smuggling syndicates could reach billions.) 
Remulla said they are already asking the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) for an estimate of loss revenue due to oil smuggling.
In 2019, the Philippine government launched the Fuel Marking Program which imposes “the mandatory marking of refined, manufactured, or imported gasoline, diesel and kerosene in the Philippines” after taxes and duties have been paid. The BIR and the Bureau of Customs (BOC) lead the implementation.  
The Philippine Institute of Petroleum, a group of industry players, has since expressed support for the government’s initiative to curb oil smuggling. 
Since 2019 and up to May 2024, the government reportedly marked P908.52 billion worth of fuel.
To recap, MV Mirola 1 ran aground in Mariveles on July 23. MV Mirola 1 reportedly sailed from Navotas without clearance from the Coast Guard.
On the same day at 11 pm, MT Terranova carrying 1.4 million liters of industrial fuel oil, departed Lamao Point in Limay en route to Iloilo. 
According to the Coast Guard’s report during the Senate hearing on Wednesday, MT Terranova reached the vicinity of Limbones Island in Cavite on July 24 at 4 am. The crew heard a loud bang and the starboard main engine suddenly stopped. They decided to go back to Bataan.
Around 6:30 pm on July 24, Mtug Procyon arrived to tow MT Terranova back to Lamao, but the latter started listing. On July 25, the tanker capsized and submerged.
Two days after MT Terranova submerged, MT Jason Bradley sank off Mariveles, Bataan on July 27 while it was anchored. It was loaded with 5,500 liters of diesel oil.
In a Teleradyo interview on Wednesday, DOJ Undersecretary Raul Vasquez mentioned that there were several “red flags” that came out as they were investigating the Bataan maritime incidents.
Vasquez mentioned that:
“It’s always one thing to say na it’s possible na intentional act ‘yan at may conspiracy,” said Vasquez. “It’s only when it’s so clear na wala that you go to other areas and other causes of action na tinatawag.”

The Biodiversity Management Bureau (BMB) under the DENR assessed critical ecosystems within a 30-kilometer radius from ground zero where MT Terranova sank. These potentially affected areas are: 
“These are areas which we continue to watch and monitor,” said Environment Secretary Toni Yulo-Loyzaga on Wednesday during the Senate hearing. 
Asian waterbird census sites are natural and man-made wetlands which are crucial habitats for migratory birds. An example is the Las Piñas-Parañaque Wetland Park, a protected area located south of Manila Bay. Staff of the wetland park recently completed four improvised 100-meter oil spill booms.
The BMB noted that the assessment is still subject to onsite validation. The results were last updated on August 4. 
MT Terranova, owned by Shogun Ships Company Incorporated, capsized and submerged at 1:10 am on July 25 off Limay, Bataan. It was carrying 1.4 million liters of industrial fuel oil, chartered by San Miguel Shipping subsidiary SL Harbor Bulk Terminal Corporation. It started leaking black oil which spread to parts of Cavite and Bataan. 
In Cavite, coastal residents cleaned up oil slicks that wound up on their shores a few days after the tanker submerged. 
Salvor Harbor Star initally put canvas bags to contain the leak and when these bags were filled, it placed metal caps on the leaking valves of MT Terranova. It took the salvor three weeks to secure all 24 valves of the ships’ tanks before siphoning operations began on Tuesday, August 13. 
Fishing has been banned in Limay, Bataan. Cavite has put several coastal towns under a state of calamity and announced a no-catch zone for shellfish. A Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) bulletin released on Tuesday, August 13, deemed fish and shellfish from Cavite still unsafe for human consumption. 
There is no update yet on the projected cost of environmental damage in Manila Bay. Last year, when the MT Princess Empress sank off Naujan in Oriental Mindoro, the DENR estimated that damage may reach P7 billion after most of the tanker’s over 800,000 liters of black oil cargo spilled into the sea.  
Alongside critical ecosystems in Manila Bay are reclamation projects which have been under review for over a year. 
Loyzaga said on Wednesday that the interim results from the cumulative impact assessment of reclamations show that these projects slow down circulation in the Bay area. 
In light of an oil spill, reclamations could make it harder for pollutants to drain out of Manila Bay, said Loyzaga.
Senate Majority Leader Francis Tolentino asked the environment secretary if reclamations could help prevent the spread of an oil spill or exacerbate the spread instead.
“It could actually exacerbate the impacts of these types of events, the oil spill,” said Loyzaga. “So the drainage of the pollutants from the Bay are what are affected by any changes that are being done in the coastal area.”  
President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. suspended reclamation projects in Manila Bay last year. 
In a previous Senate hearing on flood control projects last August 1, Loyzaga said that two reclamations are ongoing out of the 22 suspended.  
While the results of the assessment may be released by September, Loyzaga noted that “there will be an ecological cost and an economic cost to introducing anything into Manila Bay.” – Rappler.com

The BFAR has been conducting sensory evaluation of fish samples from Bataan, Bulacan, and Pampanga since MT Terranova sank off Limay, Bataan, on July 25 and caused an oil spill.
Results from sensory evaluations of fish and shellfish samples from these three provinces do not have traces of oil and grease, BFAR said.
Similarly, chemical testing from samples in Bataan and Bulacan showed that concentrations of polycylic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)– the toxic components of oil – “are significantly below levels of concern and pose no significant risk to public health.”
However, fish and shellfish from Cavite “are still not safe for human consumption based on sensory evaluation,” BFAR cautioned the public.
Samples collected from other sites – Navotas, Manila, Parañaque, Las Piñas, and Batangas – were deemed free from oil and grease contamination.
Most affected by the oil spill are fisherfolk from Cavite and Bataan, as consumers remain averse from buying fishery products in light of the maritime disaster.
Justice Undersecretary Raul Vasquez said 21,000 affected residents in Bataan will get compensation in insurance.
This comes after the earlier reported number of 31,000 Cavite fishers and vendors that will be receiving compensation.
Vasquez also mentioned that by the Philippines’ Oil Pollution Compensation Act, there is a $6.5 million fund reserved for expenses that will compensate affected communities.
The law implements the 1992 Civil Liability Convention and the 1992 Fund Convention. The Philippines is a signatory to the two conventions, but not the Supplementary Fund Protocol which could beef up the available fund for a major oil spill incident.
“All expenses of local government units and government agencies similar to the Mindoro oil spill, we told them to document that so they can claim later on for reimbursement and compensation also,” said Vasquez.

As part of initial siphoning operations, the salvor began hot tapping one of the eight tanks inside the ship. Lieutenant Commander Michael John Encina explained that hot tapping meant putting a pipe on the surface of the tank where water could go through.
“Through water flooding, the oil will surface. And then the oil on the surface will be siphoned,” Encina explained in a mix of Filipino and English.
This method, Encina said, would reduce risk of any unnecessary movement while the salvor removes contaminants.
Through the initial oil siphoning, the salvor can assess the flow rate of the oil that will help them determine the timeline for when they may start full-blown siphoning operations.
All 24 valves have been sealed, half of which had canvas seals installed, while the other half had fabricated metal caps. The PCG earlier estimated that it would take two weeks for the metal caps to be fabricated and installed. 
Initially, the Coast Guard said the plan was to siphon out around 300,000 liters of industrial fuel oil to float MT Terranova. But now, all contaminants will be removed from the tanker before it gets towed to the shoreline.
“The intention is to extract all the contaminants before the conduct of salvage operation,” said Encina. “That means all IFO (industrial fuel oil) will be extracted to ensure that there will be no contaminants on board.”
MT Terranova, owned by Shogun Ships Company Incorporated, capsized and submerged at 1:10 am on July 25 off Limay, Bataan. It was carrying 1.4 million liters of industrial fuel oil, chartered by San Miguel Shipping subsidiary SL Harbor Bulk Terminal Corporation.
As the salvor slowly starts the process of siphoning out oil from the tanker, the government continues to investigate circumstances surrounding the Bataan oil spill and the other troubled vessels. 
The Department of Justice is looking at a possible oil smuggling case where MT Terranova, along with other troubled vessels MT Jason Bradley and MV Mirola 1, are involved. (READ: Was MT Terranova, other troubled ships in Bataan involved in oil smuggling?)
“The Jason Bradley, in fact, has a seizure order from [the Bureau of] Customs because it was involved in a pending case due to oil smuggling,” DOJ Undersecretary Raul Vasquez told reporters on Tuesday in Filipino.
“That’s according to the investigation of the NBI [National Bureau of Investigation] when they were verifying records.”
The justice undersecretary pointed out that Jason Bradley and MV Mirola 1, which ran aground in Mariveles, sailed without clearance from the PCG. MV Mirola 1 is also an unregistered vessel, said Vasquez.
MT Jason Bradley sank on July 27 off Mariveles.
In a statement dated July 27, chief engineer Juanito Canillo said they encountered strong winds and heavy swells during their prolonged stay at anchorage. Canillo said their situation “deteriorated significantly” as they neared shallow waters.
“During the lifting of the anchor and maneuvering, we were struck by three successive waves, causing the vessel to capsize,” Canillo’s statement read.
“At approximately 1230 or 1240 hours, we were forced to abandon the vessel as it was sinking.”
The PCG reported on Monday, August 12, that MT Jason Bradley is now partially afloat as seawater is being siphoned out of the tanker.
The said vessel may be expected to fully float within two weeks, Encina said. – Rappler.com

9,https://www.rappler.com/business/things-to-know-shogun-ships-mt-terranova-bataan/,FAST FACTS: Things to know about MT Terranova owner Shogun Ships,2024-08-10T18:00:00+08:00,"MANILA, Philippines – Here are some information on Shogun Ships Company Incorporated (SSCI), the company that owns Motor Tanker Terranova. The tanker capsized and submerged off Limay, Bataan, last July 25, carrying 1.4 million liters of industrial fuel oil.
Shogun Ships is a local shipping firm that businessman Vicente Cordero Jr. established back in 2002. The company was registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on November 28, 2002.
Aside from MT Terranova, Shogun Ships’ fleet for transporting petroleum products includes:
Here’s some information from documents the company submitted to the SEC, as obtained by Rappler. 
Shogun Ships’ primary purpose is to engage in “the general business of domestic shipping, to own and operate vessels of any class, type of description of domestic trade, to charter in and out such vessel.”
Its officers are:
The majority of shares are owned by the Cordero family, with Vicente Cordero Jr. owning 45% of shares, exceeding that of Cordero Alliance Holdings at 37.20%.
Vicente Cordero III, who currently serves as Shogun Ships’ president, owns 2.19% of shares. The company’s total paid-up capital is P1 billion.
Since the sinking of MT Terranova, only Leonelle Mojal-Infante, carrying the name of Portavaga Ship Management Incorporated, gave an interview to deny the allegations that their tanker was involved in oil smuggling. The Department of Justice had said that they are currently investigating the events that led to the oil spill, looking at the possibility that the “paihi” system — where a large tanker transfers oil to smaller tankers to evade taxes — was carried out. 
Portavaga was registered with the SEC on March 28, 2011.
Its primary purpose is “to carry on the business of ship management and to act as agent, broker, ship chandler, or representative of foreign shipping corporation and individuals.”
The company’s revenue for 2023 reported to the SEC amounted to P113,278,229. Revenue pertains to “services provided to Shogun Ships. Co. Inc. for vessel operations and crewing management,” according to their financial statements covering 2022 to 2023.
Portavaga’s officers are:
Its total paid-up capital is P500,000, raised by five stockholders.
Both SSCI and Portavaga’s office are in Pasig City, around three kilometers away from each other.
Aside from transport of petroleum products, Shogun Ships has also ventured into the passenger sector.
It owns Island Water, a company that owns and operates roll-on/roll-off (RoRo) vessels. On its website, Island Water says it aims to “provide high quality service with a touch and feel of a cruise ship.”
The RoRo vessels that Island Water owns include the following:
These ships ply routes from Batangas to Abra de Ilog in Occidental Mindoro, and from Batangas to Puerto Galera.
In 2019, Shogun Ships supported the government’s Cavite-Metro Manila ferry service, giving free rides on the MV Island Sabtang for the first month. 
While they have been in talks with local governments and the Philippine Coast Guard for compensation and oil spill response, Shogun Ships has yet to formally address the public and answer questions on accountability in relation to the maritime disaster.
On the night of July 24, MT Terranova started listing on Bataan waters while being towed by a tugboat. The next day, the ship sank. Shogun Ships had contracted salvor Harbor Star to conduct siphoning and salvage operations. – Rappler.com

“As observed, it’s not yet alarming since only a little is coming out and the tanker itself is still intact,” PCG spokesperson Rear Admiral Armando Balilo said in Filipino during a press conference on Saturday, July 27.
Balilo said that divers from Harbor Star Shipping Services conducted an initial assessment of the ship earlier on Saturday and found leaks coming from the tanker’s valves. The PCG could not immediately confirm the number of leaks found or the amount of oil already spilled.
The PCG also said the oil spill has grown to between 12 to 14 kilometers long, based on an aerial survey report by the Philippine Space Agency and reports on the ground. However, because the oil found was not too dark, it’s possible that the oil spill includes a mix of both operational oil from the ship and industrial fuel oil from its cargo.
Local governments have also been told to brace for the effects of the oil spill. Based on the current trajectory of the oil spill, it could possibly affect communities in Bataan and Cavite.
Saturday’s diving team had been on standby since Friday, July 26, but waited for the weather and sea condition to improve before continuing the operation.
Oil tanker MT Terranova was carrying 1.4 million liters of industrial fuel oil when it sank on Thursday, July 25, off Bataan province. The PCG said that attempts are now underway to recover its cargo before it causes a wider oil spill.
Shogun Ships Company Incorporated, owner of the sunken ship, has tapped Harbor Star Shipping Services to salvage the tanker and respond to the oil spill. Harbor Star was also among the companies that responded to the Mindoro oil spill in 2023 caused by the sinking of oil tanker MT Princess Empress.
Optimistically, the PCG estimates that it could complete siphoning within seven days, considering the oil tanker sank in shallow waters.
However, Balilo said that under the “worst-case scenario,” the oil spill could stretch all the way into the vicinity waters of Parañaque, Manila, Navotas, Bulacan, and Pampanga. The coast guard has already deployed oil containment booms.
According to Limay Mayor Nelson David, around 400 to 500 liters of the vessel’s engine fuel leaked out. Authorities have observed an oil slick in the area, although there are no reports yet if the industrial fuel oil of the tanker was already spilling.
“There’s nothing to worry about, but we would not be complacent,” PCG spokesperson Rear Admiral Armando Balilo said in Filipino on Friday, July 26.
“We are still preparing for the worst-case scenario to address the potential negative impact to the marine environment.” – Rappler.com

The no-cure, no-pay contract between both parties includes oil spill response operations to minimize  possible environmental damage, Harbor Star told the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) on Friday, July 26. The maritime services provider immediately sent its tugboats and salvage equipment to Bataan. 
A no-cure, no pay contract means that Harbor Star will not be paid if it is unable to fulfill the terms of the  agreement. 
The Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) reported that MT Terranova capsized and eventually submerged at 1:10 am on Thursday, around 3.6 nautical miles or around seven kilometers east off Lamao Point in Limay, Bataan. Sixteen crew members were rescued while the body of the last missing crew member was located by BRP Melchora Aquino later in the afternoon.
The maritime incident happened even though the weather disturbance from the southwest monsoon or habagat had already weakened on Thursday. 
Harbor Star was one of the companies tapped in last year’s Mindoro oil spill, after MT Princess Empress sank on February 23, 2023 off the coast of Naujan, Oriental Mindoro. Similar to this new incident, MT Princess Empress left Limay, Bataan with 900,000 liters of industrial fuel oil. It was owned by Reield Marine Services and was chartered by a San Miguel shipping subsidiary to transport the black oil to Iloilo. 
Limay Mayor Nelson David told Radyo 360 on Friday that around 400 to 500 liters of the vessel’s engine fuel leaked. There are no reports yet if the industrial fuel oil it was carrying was already spilling, as of writing. 
The Department of Environment and Natural Resources has deployed its survey vessel BRG Hydrographer Presbitero to locate the sunken ship. 
PCG also deployed three 44-meter multi-role response vessels for the oil spill response operations.
“These vessels will start the application of oil dispersants to immediately mitigate impact, especially during the period where siphoning is being prepared,” said PCG Commandant Ronnie Gil Gavan on Thursday. 
According to Gavan, the PCG hopes to finish siphoning operations in seven days.
“The vessel sunk 34 meters deep which is considerably shallow. Siphoning will not be very technical and can be done quickly to protect the vicinity waters of Bataan and Manila Bay against environmental, social, economic, financial, and political impacts,” said PCG spokesperson Rear Admiral Armando Balilo. 
However, the spokesperson said they are still preparing for the worst-case scenario. At 1 pm Friday, PCG officials met with representatives from SSCI and salvor Harbor Star to discuss the timeline of siphoning operations.
“Walang dapat ipag-alala, pero hindi kami nagpapakampante,” Balilo said. (There’s nothing to worry about, but we will not be complacent.)
In the worst-case scenario, vicinity waters of Parañaque, Manila, Navotas, Bulacan, and Pampanga would be affected.
“We are utilizing our manpower, mobilizing our resources, consulting with experts, and collaborating with LGUs and other stakeholders to avoid a marine environment catastrophe,” said Balilo.
Balilo also clarified there was no public storm warning signal raised over Bataan when MT Terranova set sail. 
Currently, the PCG is conducting a joint marine casualty investigation with the Maritime Industry Authority.
The Philippines’ largest oil firm Petron Corporation has volunteered to help in the oil spill response. Petron, part of the San Miguel Group of companies, operates a refinery in Limay.
Groups have called on the government and the shipowner to control the spread of the oil spill to prevent harm to the environment and coastal communities. 
“The owners of MT Terranova and its cargo must come forward and claim responsibility: foot the bill for any environmental damage this may cause, and provide compensation to the communities affected,” said Jefferson Chua, climate campaigner for Greenpeace.
“The government must also ensure that the full weight of our legal system is applied to ensuring justice for the people of Limay and the other communities in the area,” Chua added.
International organization Oceana stressed the implementation of the recently passed Philippine Ecosystem and Natural Cost Accounting System (PENCAS) law to estimate the cost incurred from the maritime disaster. 
“All those responsible for failing to prevent this tragedy – from concerned government agencies to private owners of the tanker – should be held accountable,” said Gloria Estenzo Ramos, vice president of Oceana. 
“Considering the oil spills’ destructive impacts on our fishing grounds and habitats, not to mention that majority of our population rely on a healthy and productive marine ecosystems for sustenance, it is time to impose even higher penalties and stricter accountability measures and implement the PENCAS law,” added Ramos. – Rappler.com

Encina said the 14 leaking valves of the submerged tanker have been closed on Monday. Siphoning would start as soon as all valves, including the ones without leaks, are sealed.
“That will be the main activity of our operation tomorrow: the siphoning process,” Encina said in a mix of Filipino and English.
“So technically the salvor will siphon 300,000 liters of IFO (industrial fuel oil) to float MT Terranova. Hence after that, we can bring the vessel near the shoreline so we can do other measures to avert the oil spill.”
Even valves without leaks must be sealed too because when the vessel lifts as the oil is siphoned out, they might open, Encina explained.
Siphoning may last from five to seven days. Encina said a conservative estimate would be 10 days. The Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) had earlier set a 7-day target last week. PCG spokesperson Rear Admiral Armand Balilo said earlier in a radio interview on Monday morning that 15 valves were yet to be sealed. 
The contracted salvor for this oil spill response is Harbor Star, under a no-cure, no-pay contract with ship owner Shogun Ships Company Incorporated. 
En route to Iloilo, MT Terranova was carrying 1.4 million liters of industrial fuel oil when it sank 3.6 nautical miles from Lamao point in Limay, Bataan. One crew member died in the maritime incident, while 16 other crew were rescued. The Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources estimated that 11,000 fisherfolk from Bataan will be affected under the worst-case scenario. 
Reports of oil slick sightings have come in from Bulacan and Cavite, two provinces where scientists have forecast the oil to spread.
Aside from capping the valves, the PCG had deployed oil spill booms to contain spread. They have also started to make improvised booms from coconut husks.
However, oil spill booms only work in calm sea conditions, Natalie Kirk, a representative from non-government organization International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation Limited (ITOPF) said during a meeting with concerned government officials in Pampanga province on Monday, July 29.
“So if we have rough weather…it doesn’t work. And at best, the estimates are that we can recover about 10 to 20% of the oil spilt using containment and recovery,” said Kirk.
The ITOPF representative said the most effective way of responding to the oil spill is to concentrate on the salvage efforts and in removing the oil from the vessel. – Rappler.com

CG Rear Admiral Armando Balilo, spokesman of the PCG, said Coast Guard divers sealed the leaks found on the vessel.
The shipping company initially said that it had no cargo fuel onboard. However, the PCG found an unknown amount of diesel cargo on the vessel.
“The PCG response team is working on properly removing the diesel cargo with the help of a contracted salvor,” the PCG said, adding that it will conduct an investigation after recovering the cargo.
The oil tanker sank 9 meters deep off the waters of Barangay Cabcaben in Mariveles Bataan. It was found 600 yards away from the shore.
According to an initial report from the PCG, three 44-meter Coast Guard vessels were sent to respond to the incident at 5 pm on Saturday, July 27.
“As of press time, the shipping company is preparing the equipment needed for the salvage operations that will be completed in one to two weeks,” the PCG said in its initial statement on Sunday.
The MTKR Jason Bradley is the second oil tanker that sank off waters of Bataan within days.

PCG personnel were manually scooping out the oil inside the vessel. They would then bring the recovered oil in a waste disposal facility to avoid posing health risks to residents.
The vessel was reported on July 23 to have run aground in the vicinity waters of Sitio Quiapo, Barangay Biaan in Mariveles. (Editor’s Note: An earlier version of this story said the vessel ran aground on July 31. This has been corrected.)

The DA validated that 28,373 fisherfolk are affected out of the projected 46,090.
Since the oil spill in Bataan after oil tanker MT Terranova capsized and submerged on July 25, fishing had been banned in Limay, Bataan. Cavite had declared a no-catch zone on all shellfish products.
Bataan Governor Jose Enrique Garcia III recently placed the province under a state of calamity, estimating around 17,000 fisherfolk affected.
A state of calamity was also declared in several coastal towns in Cavite.
Cavite Governor Jonvic Remulla said 31,000 fisherfolk and vendors could expect a compensation of P350 a day until people regain confidence in buying fishery products.
The Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources cautioned the public against consuming fish caught in areas where oil slicks have been observed.
The salvor is set to siphon the oil out of MT Terranova soon, after all fabricated metal caps have been installed on the tanker’s valves. The Philippine Coast Guard and salvor Harbor Star simulated the siphoning operations on Wednesday.
Aside from containment and community assistance, the Department of Justice is investigating the circumstances that led to the oil spill as well as the liable parties.

16,https://www.rappler.com/philippines/was-mt-terranova-other-troubled-ships-bataan-involved-oil-smuggling/,"Was MT Terranova, other troubled ships in Bataan involved in oil smuggling?",2024-08-05T14:44:19+08:00,"MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Justice (DOJ) is investigating whether sunken MT Terranova and two other troubled vessels in Bataan were involved in the “paihi” system or oil smuggling.
“May intelligence reports naman na ‘paihi’ system ang umiral,” Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin “Boying” Remulla said in a DZRH radio interview on August 3, Saturday. (There are intelligence reports that the ‘paihi‘ system was carried out.)
The term “paihi” literally means to urinate in Filipino, but has come to refer to an oil smuggling method where a large tanker transfers oil to smaller tankers to evade taxes.
“Tapos ‘yung isa pang tumaob na vessel…walang makina. Pero malaki ang fuel berth niya. Malaki ang kanyang cargo area. Ginawa nilang tanker pero hinihila lang.” (And then the other vessel that capsized had no engine. But it has a huge fuel berth. It has a large cargo area. They used it as a tanker that could be towed.)
Remulla said the Philippine Coast Guard traced the movement of MT Terranova through its global positioning system device and found that it had been circling in vicinity waters of Bataan for 26 hours since it sailed last July 23.
“Doon sila nagpapaihi. Doon sila nagbebenta ng smuggled fuel,” said Remulla. (That’s where they sell smuggled fuel.)
MT Terranova, owned by Shogun Ships Company Incorporated, capsized and submerged at 1:10 am on July 25 off Limay, Bataan. It was carrying 1.4 million liters of industrial fuel oil, chartered by San Miguel Shipping subsidiary SL Harbor Bulk Terminal Corporation. 
The night before or at 10:57 pm on July 24, MT Terranova started listing (or tilting to one side) while it was being towed by tugboat MTug Procyon en route to the anchorage area. Metro Manila and other parts of Luzon were then still grappling with the impact of the southwest monsoon or habagat enhanced by Typhoon Carina. 
MT Terranova started spilling industrial fuel oil hours later. The shipowner then contracted maritime services firm Harbor Star to salvage the tanker and to help in the oil spill cleanup. Harbor Star plugged the oil leak with canvas bags, but these bags eventually got filled with oil leaks. It said it would have to fabricate metals caps to plug the leaking valves, thus delaying the oil siphoning operations by two weeks. 
On July 27, Saturday, two days after MT Terranova sank, the Coast Guard confirmed the sinking of MTKR Jason Bradley also in Bataan, complicating further the cleanup operations. The ship was carrying 5,500 liters of diesel although the ship owner initially denied the tanker was carrying fuel. 
On the same day that MT Terranova sailed on July 23, the Coast Guard received a report that another vessel, MV Mirola 1, ran aground in Mariveles, Bataan. 
Remulla earlier said his department was probing whether all three cases of troubled vessels in Bataan were related. 
“All three are interconnected, we believe,” Remulla told reporters on Friday, August 2. “The first two vessels especially. First two vessels.”
The justice chief said a class action lawsuit is being eyed against the shipowner and others involved.
“We’re looking into the angle of a class suit already filed by the fishermen against the owners and others who may responsible for this,” said Remulla. He claimed that “the country has not seen a case like this filed yet.”
Meantime, Leonelle Mojal-Infante, spokesperson of shipowner Portavaga Ship Management Incorporated, denied the justice secretary’s allegation in an interview with ABS-CBN News on Monday, August 5. 
She said MT Terranova could not have been engaged in the “paihi” system or oil smuggling because the seals of the tanker can only be opened in its delivery destination.
“Nabubuksan lang ‘yan ng kung saan ‘yan i-de-deliver. So ang magbubukas lang niyan ‘yung pag-de-deliveran mo. So it is not possible na ‘yung mga lumalabas na kesyo nagpaihi or something, hindi siya possible sa barko namin,” she said. 
(It could only be opened where it will be delivered. It can only be opened by the receiver. So it’s not possible, the allegations that came out about oil smuggling or something, that’s not possible in our ship.)
Mojal-Infante also said they have all the proper permits from the Maritime Industry Authority, the Philippine Ports Authority, and the Coast Guard.
“We only deal with reputable oil companies in the Philippines and lahat po ‘yun ay (all are) under a legitimate contract,” she said. (We only deal with reputable oil companies in the Philippines and all of those are under a legitimate contract.) 
Cavite Governor Jonvic Remulla, the justice secretary’s brother, told Noveleta residents on Saturday that the shipowner will be sued in a bid to get compensation for affected communities.
“Kakasuhan po natin ang may-ari ng barko para lahat kayo ay mabayaran sa nangyari dito sa Noveleta, nangyari sa distrito ng buong coastal ng Cavite,” he said. 
(We will file a case against the shipowner so that everyone in Noveleta, the whole coastal district of Cavite, will get compensation.)
The Cavite governor declared parts of the province under a state of calamity after the Bataan oil spill reached their shores last week. Remulla said the estimated cost of damage in Cavite could reach P1 billion, with 25,000 fisherfolk affected in the province.
Fisherfolk group Pamalakaya said on Monday, August 5, that the government must step up efforts to help fishers from Cavite and Bataan whose livelihood are at risk in light of the maritime disaster.
“Dapat hindi na makatakas sa pananagutan ang kumpanyang sangkot sa oil spill, na nauna nang tinukoy ng Philippine Coast Guard na may kaugnayan sa San Miguel Corporation,” said Ronnel Arambulo, vice chairperson of Pamalakaya, in a statement.
“Ito rin ang parehong kumpanya na sangkot sa mapaminsalang oil spill sa Oriental Mindoro noong nakaraang taon, na hanggang ngayon ay pinagdudusahan pa rin ng mga mangingisda.”
(The company involved in the oil spill, which the Philippine Coast Guard confirmed has ties with San Miguel Corporation, shouldn’t get away. This is the same company involved in the disastrous oil spill in Oriental Mindoro the past year, which until now fisherfolk are suffering from.)

BATAAN, Philippines — The Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) planned Friday to deploy oil dispersant and floating barriers a day after a tanker carrying 1.4 million liters of industrial fuel sank off Limay municipality in this province.
Agence France-Presse journalists at the Port of Limay watched PCG personnel preparing equipment for a boat to be used against the slick in Manila Bay.
The MT Terra Nova sank in rough seas nearly seven kilometers (4.3 miles) off Limay municipality early Thursday after setting out for the central city of Iloilo.
An oil slick stretching several kilometers has been detected in the waterway, which thousands of fishermen and tourism operators rely on for their livelihoods.
READ: Tanker with 1.4M liters of oil sinks off Bataan; ‘working fuel’ leaks
But PCG spokesman Rear Admiral Armando Balilo told a briefing Thursday that it appeared diesel fuel used to power the tanker had leaked and, so far, not the industrial fuel oil cargo.
The PCG has set a target of seven days to offload the cargo and prevent what Balilo warned would be the worst oil spill in Philippine history if it were to leak.
The incident happened as heavy rains fueled by Typhoon Gaemi, locally named Carina, and the seasonal monsoon lashed Manila and surrounding regions early in the week.
After setting out late Wednesday, the captain decided to abort the journey to Iloilo due to rough seas, but as the vessel turned back it was swamped by large waves and went down.
One crew member died, but 16 were rescued.
An investigation into the cause of the incident was underway but Balilo said Thursday the vessel had not broken rules on heavy-weather sailing.
Campaign group Greenpeace said the owners of MT Terra Nova should “foot the bill” for any environmental damage and compensate affected communities.

One of the worst oil spills in the Philippines was in February 2023, when a tanker carrying 800,000 liters of industrial fuel oil sank off the central island of Mindoro.
Diesel fuel and thick oil from that vessel contaminated the waters and beaches along the coast of Oriental Mindoro province, devastating the fishing and tourism industries.
The oil dispersed over hundreds of kilometers of waters famed for having some of the most diverse marine life in the world.

It is but small comfort that only the “working fuel,” or the diesel fuel used to power MT Terra Nova, has leaked so far, and not the industrial fuel oil cargo. The vessel, headed for Iloilo, capsized and eventually submerged off Lamao Point, Limay, Bataan, right at the mouth of Manila Bay, early Thursday morning just as Supertyphoon “Carina” left devastation behind. As of Friday, reports said an oil slick stretching about 3.7 kilometers was being carried by a strong current. Authorities were worried that it would reach Manila Bay, and also affect Navotas, Bulacan, and Pampanga depending on the wind direction and sea currents.
The PCG has absolved MT Terra Nova from breaking any rules on heavy-weather sailing because, per its spokesperson Rear Admiral Armand Balilo, the weather bureau has not issued a typhoon signal over Bataan when it started to sail late Wednesday. The ship’s captain only decided to turn back when the vessel encountered large waves. By then, it was too late—one of the 17 crew members was later found dead.
The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical Services Administration, in fact, has issued regular weather bulletins on Carina and as early as Tuesday warned of rough seas over the northern and eastern seaboards of Northern Luzon and eastern seaboards of Central Luzon. Authorities must investigate the incident to determine accountability—were there other factors why the vessel left the port despite bad weather conditions?
But first, authorities must contain the spill and mobilize local and international support—the PCG has given itself seven days to complete the siphoning operations. That the ship sunk in a relatively shallow area could help contain the disaster and hasten salvage operations although this still depends on the kind of fuel used. Most ships use heavy fuel oil which spreads slower but is stickier and more difficult to clean up. Shogun Ships Company Inc., the ship’s owner, has tapped Harbor Star Shipping Services under a “no cure, no pay” contract, meaning, to get paid, the latter must fulfill the terms of agreement including minimizing possible environmental damage and salvaging the industrial fuel oil contained in the tanker.
Harbor Star was also one of the companies contracted for the shoreline cleanup and disposal of oily waste in last year’s oil spill involving MT Princess Empress. The oil tanker, carrying 900,000 liters of industrial oil, sunk off Naujan, Oriental Mindoro, on Feb. 28, 2023, on the way to Iloilo.
The spill eventually reached the coastal communities of Oriental Mindoro, Batangas, Antique, and Palawan, affecting 200,000 people across three regions, including 27,850 fisherfolk. It also affected the Verde Island Passage, an important area for marine biodiversity. The government estimated total damage to the ecosystem and dependent coastal communities at P5.1 billion but the Center for Energy, Ecology, and Development placed it at P41.2 billion.The damage in this most recent oil spill could be more extensive and the government must look into the Mindoro oil spill case and what it can do better this time. The top criticism was the delay in assisting fisherfolk and providing them with alternative sources of income. Local communities should also be assisted in responding to disasters like this as immediate response is crucial.
The country has several laws and regulations to prevent oil spills and hold companies accountable for their actions but enforcement and implementation remain problematic. The legal process can be complicated and time-consuming for fisherfolk and coastal communities, who do not have resources at their disposal, to pursue.
This should not be the norm, however, and the government must use the full extent of the law to make rich companies behind these disasters pay because the damage caused to the environment and the communities is permanent.
As Lea Guerrero, Greenpeace Philippines country director, said: “Even [if] an oil spill has been declared clear, there are portions of the sea which never really recover. A lot of the cleaning and the clearing that you see are the visible effect, the visible sign of the spill but a lot of it is happening under the water where the chemicals [affect] marine life … It’s not just the cleaning of the oil spill that we’re talking about [but] the compounding effects on communities that are reliant on a healthy marine environment.” Environmentalists also reiterated their call for the Marcos administration to end dependence on fossil fuels and expedite the transition to renewable energy.
Indeed, it is not enough to contain this latest disaster—the government must prevent future incidents from happening, as they always take a heavy toll on the environment and ordinary Filipinos.

MANILA, Philippines—As the oil spill from three sunken vessels — MT Terranova, MTKR Jason Bradley, and MV Mirola 1 — spreads across a significant portion of Manila Bay, contaminating the waters of Cavite, Bulacan, and Bataan, authorities are issuing urgent warnings about the severe health risks posed by exposure to this environmental disaster.
While the government, environmental organizations, and health authorities intensify their efforts to manage the escalating crisis, the public is strongly urged to take preventive measures.
An international ocean protection and conservation group further warned about how the toxic spill continues to pose a grave threat to the environment and the health and livelihood of communities in affected areas.
The series of maritime disasters began on July 25, 2024, when MT Terra Nova, a tanker carrying 1.4 million liters of industrial fuel oil, capsized off the coast of Limay, Bataan. The vessel, en route to Iloilo, sank while Typhoon Carina (Gaemi) ravaged Metro Manila and surrounding provinces.

Just two days later, on July 27, 2024, the MTKR Jason Bradley, which was anchored in the waters off Bataan, sank nine meters deep near Barangay Cabcaben in Mariveles — approximately 600 yards from the shore.
The vessel was carrying 5,500 liters of diesel when it sank during the onslaught of Super Typhoon Carina. Initially, the shipping company claimed that there was no fuel cargo onboard.

The latest incident occurred on July 31, 2024, when the MV Mirola 1 ran aground in shallow waters off the coast of Sitio Quiapo, Barangay Biaan — also in Mariveles — causing the ship to tip over.

According to Karagatan Patrol, an online platform created by the renowned marine conservation organization Oceana, it is estimated that the oil spill from the sunken vessels affects 50 percent of Manila Bay, with the pollution spreading to Cavite, Bulacan, and Bataan.
Manila Bay serves as a crucial spawning ground for fish like sardines, a key source of protein for millions of Filipinos.
Oceana warned that the oil spill threatens to smother and kill vital mangroves, coral reefs, and seagrass beds in the bay, which are essential for the breeding and feeding of marine species.
The bay also provides habitat for at least 60 migratory bird species, including 12 threatened ones, just as their migration season begins.
“The destruction of these habitats leads to long-term ecological damage for years to come and puts the coastal nation at further risk from increasing storms,” Oceana said.
The Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) began recovery operations for the MV Mirola 1 on August 1. Photos shared on the PCG’s official Facebook page showed personnel manually collecting the oil inside the vessel.
The PCG said the collected oil was carefully placed into large drums, which were then prepared for transport to a waste disposal facility to prevent any potential health hazards to local residents.

Additionally, on August 7, the PCG took part in a simulation exercise at Lamao Port in Limay, Bataan. This drill was described as a crucial part of the ongoing siphoning operation for the MTKR Terranova.
“We learned that heavy fuel oil flows when siphoned and confirmed the necessity of hot tapping each tank to prevent water mixing,” said Harbor Star Shipping Services Inc., the salvor contracted for the cleanup.
“This process is time-consuming due to water depth and divers’ 25-minute limits. With these insights, we can establish a timeline by Friday,”it said.
Oceana has reported that traces of oil have already been detected in fishing villages in the provinces of Bulacan and Cavite. In Cavite, the Ternate Marine Park, a popular beach destination and a nesting ground for sea turtles, is also feared to be affected by the spill.

Eight towns in Cavite—Bacoor, Kawit, Noveleta, Rosario, Tanza, Naic, Maragondon, and Ternate— have already declared a “state of calamity.”
Under the Philippine Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act, a state of calamity is defined as “a condition involving mass casualty and/or major damages to property, disruption of means of livelihoods, roads and normal way of life of people in the affected areas as a result of the occurrence of natural or human-induced hazard.”
The Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) has issued a warning to the public to avoid consuming fish caught in areas impacted by the oil spill in Bataan province, as these fish are deemed unsafe for human consumption.
“[T]he Bureau maintains that as a precautionary measure, fish harvested from areas where oil slicks are observed be deemed unsafe for human consumption. This is to avoid incidents of food poisoning as a result of ingesting contaminated seafood,” BFAR said in a bulletin.
BFAR stated that it is carrying out continuous fish sample tests in the affected areas of Central Luzon, Calabarzon (Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal, and Quezon), and the National Capital Region (NCR) to determine if fish and other seafood are contaminated.
Results from a sensory evaluation showed fish samples collected from the towns of Noveleta and Rosario in Cavite province have “some degree of tainting with petrochemicals, albeit before any oil slicks were noticed in the area.”
Fish samples gathered from Cavite City as well as the towns of Tanza and Naic remain free from petrochemical contamination.

In a radio interview last July 30, PCG spokesperson Rear Admiral Armand Balilo said fishing in areas affected by the oil spill in Manila Bay is not advisable
READ: Coast Guard : Fishing in Manila Bay unsafe due to oil spill
A no-catch and no-sell zone for all shellfish has also been issued in the province of Cavite.
In addition to the BFAR’s warning, the Department of Health (DOH) emphasized the immediate health risks associated with consuming contaminated water or seafood, including symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, coughing, irritability, and unconsciousness.
The DOH also warned that ingesting large quantities of contaminated water or seafood could lead to more severe outcomes, such as convulsions, coma, or even death.
Oil spills pose a significant threat to public health, not only through ingestion but also via other forms of exposure. The immediate symptoms associated with these exposures include:
Individuals experiencing any of these symptoms due to exposure to the oil spill are urged to seek immediate medical attention at the nearest health facility or consult a health care professional.
The DOH has issued comprehensive guidelines for residents living in or near areas impacted by the oil spill, detailing both recommended actions and essential precautions.
According to the DOH, the following measures should be observed:
The DOH also provided specific instructions for responders, volunteers, and cleanup workers, highlighting the importance of the following:

Additionally, the health department asked the public to avoid the following:
“While oil spills are rare, they can cause extensive damage to marine life and pose significant health risks to those exposed,” the DOH warned.
BFAR has estimated that the oil spill will devastate the livelihood of tens of thousands of fishers in Bataan, Bulacan, Pampanga, and Cavite, with projected monthly revenue losses of up to P83.8 million in Bataan alone and more than P70 million in Bulacan and Pampanga.

Data from the Department of Agriculture (DA) further detailed that 28,373 fishers and 5,810 boats have been hit with an estimated forgone income of P78.69 million over eight days since the fishing ban was imposed on July 30, 2024.

The Pambansang Lakas ng Kilusang Mamamalakaya ng Pilipinas (Pamalakaya), a progressive fisherfolk organization, criticized the “indefinite fishing ban” imposed on nine coastal towns in Cavite, arguing that the ban is more harmful to fishers’ livelihood than the oil spill itself.
READ: Bataan fishers still waiting for assistance
“The government’s response to the oil spill has done more harm to the fishers’ livelihoods than the spill itself. While Cavite is under a fishing ban, the fishers are not receiving any regular support,” Ronnel Arambulo, vice chairperson of Pamalakaya, said in Filipino.
“We are calling for the lifting of the fishing ban because the oil is no longer directly affecting the fishing grounds of the province,” Arambulo added.
“Toxic oil spills in our oceans are like fires in our forests, leaving a path of destruction that brings decades of negative impacts,” Gloria Estenzo Ramos, Oceana’s vice president in the Philippines, said in a statement.
Ramos added that oil spills are “a deathtrap for marine ecosystems” and have detrimental effects on people, wildlife, and the environment.
She warned that if more than one million liters of oil onboard one of the sunken vessels is not safely removed, the resulting spill could have devastating effects, potentially killing marine wildlife, destroying mangroves, and endangering people’s health, food supply, and livelihood.

“We know what’s at stake here: jobs, food, exports, and even lives. Even after the oil pollution is cleaned up, seafood may be contaminated for years,” she said.
Ramos also underscored the long-term impact on the country, stating: “[t]he people of the Philippines will be dealing with the impacts of this devastation long after the headlines fade, and the government must do everything it can to mitigate this disaster as quickly as possible.”

MANILA, Philippines—With a coastline stretching over 18,000 kilometers and coastal waters covering 266,000 kilometers, the Philippines has seen some devastating oil spills in previous years.
Last week, a tanker carrying 800,000 liters of industrial fuel capsized at Balingawan Point in Tablas Strait near Naujan and the island province of Marinduque after it experienced engine trouble.
On February 28, MT Princess Empress, bound for Iloilo from Bataan, began to sink after its engine overheated due to straining amid rough sea conditions.
The following day, the tanker plunged 460 meters below sea level.
According to the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG), the oil spill has already reached the island town of Caluya, between Mindoro and Panay. It has also been observed along the shoreline of Barangay Buhay na Tubig in Pola town.
Officials from several coastal towns of Oriental Mindoro have already declared states of calamity.
As government agencies and experts assess the extent of the damage caused by the oil spill from MV Princess Empress, INQUIRER.net looks back at some of the biggest oil spills in the country.
In the past years, similar spills—some even more significant and devastating—have threatened other parts of the country.
On August 11, 2006, strong winds and high waves battered the oil tanker MT Solar I off the southern coast of Guimaras while it was carrying 2 million liters of bunker fuel from Petron Corp. The tanker was on its way to Zamboanga City from Bataan when it was overcome by unusually rough waves.

Known as the worst oil spill in the country’s history, the spill affected 1,500 hectares of the local ecosystem—including mangroves, seagrass, and coral reefs—and has severely affected the province’s marine resources, tourism industry, and economy.
According to The Manila Bay Oil Spill Contingency Plan, the largest oil spill that occurred in Manila Bay took place in Mariveles, Bulacan on July 1999, when MT Mary Anne spilled a total volume of 747,991 liters of oil.
A year before, in September 1998, MV Princess of the Orient was carrying around 600,000 liters of bunker oil and 11,000 liters of lubricating oil when it sank off Batangas and caused a massive oil spill in Manila Bay.
In August 2013, an aerial survey conducted by the PCG discovered that an estimated 500,000 liters of diesel spilled into the waters off Cavite, affecting at least four towns in the province (Rosario, Naic, Tanza, and Ternate).
Initial investigations pointed at the oil tanker MT Makisig as the source of the leak. Due to the damage caused by the spill, environmental advocates described the incident as “a repeat performance” of the “worst maritime oil disaster in the Philippines.”
Another massive oil spill hit Manila Bay in March 1999 when the tanker MT Sea Brothers sank in the bay while carrying 420,000 liters of bunker oil.
In December 2005, an oil barge of the National Power Corp. capsized off the shore of Semirara in Antique, spilling almost 200,000 liters of oil and contaminating about 40 square kilometers of water off Semirara.
Based on Greenpeace’s oil spill damage assessment, the oil spill affected over 100 hectares of mangrove and beach area and the island. The livelihood of at least 21 families likewise took a hit due to the spill.
Oil spills in Manila Bay, a key economic gateway where the majority of the country’s economic activities take place, are more common than some might think.
The Global Environment Facility (GEF)—United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)—International Maritime Organization Regional Programme on Building Partnerships in Environmental Management for the Seas of East Asia (PEMSEA) found that, on average, around 30,000 vessels enter Manila Bay each year.
“A majority of these vessels, which include tankers, passenger and cargo ships, either utilizes oil as fuel or carries it as their cargo. Ship-sourced pollution may result from either accidental or illegal operational discharge of these vessels,” the GEF-UNDP-PEMSEA explained.

Oil spills could also occur during the process of loading and unloading petroleum products in the oil refineries within the bay. The depots found in Manila Bay’s shoreline include:
“Aside from these depots that dot the Manila Bay coast, a large depot could also be found in Pandacan, Manila. Even though the depot is located inside the Pasig River and is kilometers away from the bay itself, the amount of petroleum stored in its tank farms could pose a significant threat to Manila Bay,” said GEF-UNDP-PEMSEA.
Historical data showed a total of 18 oil spills within Manila Bay from February 1998 to December 2004. Nine took place in the province of Bataan, in the ports of Limay and Mariveles, with a total volume of 789,751 liters.
Data also showed that most oil spills in Manila Bay occur where vessel traffic is heavy.
Among the crucial parts of oil spill risk assessment involves identifying risk factors that may cause them.
According to The Manila Bay Oil Spill Contingency Plan, the risk factors identified in Manila Bay waters based on previously recorded spills include:
Aside from listing the risk-causing factors, the assessment also listed other factors that may heighten the risk of oil spills.

Some of the most common factors that impact the risk of oil spills from occurring are various shipping-related risks like:
Environmental factors—including tidal flow, weather, current, wind temperature, sea state, and type of shoreline—could also increase the possibility of oil spills.
Other factors like future trends, the presence of oil terminals and depots, and the capacity and capability of the response team could also escalate the chances and dangers of oil spills, according to GEF-UNDP-PEMSEA.
GRAPHIC Ed Lustan
In terms of sources of oil spills, records from the PCG secured by the National Operation Center for Oil Pollution (NOCOP) found that vessels are the top sources of major spills in the country.
From 1975 to 2019, a total of 305 major oil spills involved domestic, local, and foreign vessels that were usually engaged in domestic or international trading.
“Vessels are sources of oil spill when they are involved in collision…grounding and the likes,” NOSCOP stated.
Power plants and power barges; shipyards; refineries, terminals and depots; oil exploration and production activities; offshore mining activities; and industrial and manufacturing activities are also listed as sources of oil spills.
In some cases, however, NOSCOP noted that “mystery” spills occur where the spiller or source of the spillage and leak is unknown.

Authorities are rushing efforts to prevent a repeat of last year’s disastrous oil spill off Mindoro Island after a local oil tanker carrying 1.4 million liters of industrial fuel sank about 7 kilometers east of Limay town in Bataan province early Thursday, according to the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG).
Rear Adm. Armand Balilo, the PCG spokesperson, said MT Terra Nova capsized and sank at 1:10 a.m. on Thursday in rough waters close to the mouth of Manila Bay while the oil tanker was on its way to Iloilo province.
READ: Oil spill from sunken tanker off Bataan may reach Manila shores – PCG
He warned that if all the ship’s cargo leaked, it would become the worst oil spill in the country’s history.
“We are racing against time and we will try to do our best to contain it immediately and stop the fuel from leaking,” he said.
“There is a big danger that Manila will be affected, even the shoreline of Manila if the fuel [leaks] because it is within Manila Bay,” he added.
Balilo said 16 of the 17 crew on board have been rescued. The body of a missing crew member was found on Thursday afternoon off Limay.
The ship is 34 meters underwater, which is “considerably shallow,” he said.
Balilo said the surviving crew told the PCG that their ship left Bataan on Wednesday night and was hit by big waves as they were about to sail away from the waters of Corregidor.
“At about 10 p.m., they felt that the waves were strong and the captain decided to return,” he said. “But immediately, they had a hard time returning because they were met by strong waves and the term that the crew used was ‘sumalok sila ng alon’ (scooped up waves) until the ship was filled with water and they completely capsized.”
Manila and nearby provinces, including Bataan, then were experiencing torrential rains and winds from Supertyphoon “Carina” (international name: Gaemi).
In a statement on Thursday night, MT Terra Nova’s ship manager, Portavaga Ship Management, identified the dead crew member as Second Mate Alvin Llandelar. He was 40 and married.
An aerial inspection on Thursday showed an oil spill about 3.7 km long east of Lamao Point in Limay and moving east to northeast carried by strong currents, according to Balilo.
What was leaking, for now, was the “working fuel” used by the ship’s engines, he said.
“So far, the oil spill is minimal,” according to Balilo.
He said marine environmental protection personnel had been mobilized to deal with the spill.
PCG Commandant Adm. Ronnie Gil Gavan has ordered deploying three 44-meter multi-role response vessels to augment ongoing oil spill response operations in Bataan.
“These vessels will start the application of oil dispersants to immediately mitigate the impact, especially during the period where siphoning is being prepared,” Gavan said.
He said the PCG was targeting to finish siphoning the industrial fuel from the 22-year-old tanker in seven days.
Siphoning would “not be very technical” and could be done quickly to protect the waters of Bataan and Manila Bay “against environmental, social, economic, financial and political impacts,” said Balilo.
In February last year, a tanker carrying 800,000 liters of industrial fuel sank below 369 meters about 14 km northeast of Balisangan Point, Pola, Oriental Mindoro.
Almost four months later, most of the cargo of the MR Princess Empress had either leaked away or been siphoned off.
The Mindoro oil spill reached as far as Palawan and Batangas provinces.
President Marcos ordered the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) to undertake measures to mitigate the environmental damage that might result from an oil spill from the Terra Nova.
The President said the DENR can work with the Department of Science and Technology in making immediate meteorological assessments, referring to the location of the vessel, and the speed and direction of the winds and currents.
“Hopefully, we can catch it (the oil spill) before [it makes] landfall. But with the seas being so rough, it will be a bit more difficult,” he said.
He said the authorities would have to determine which coastal areas the oil spill was headed to “so that we can try and prepare for that.”
In Bataan, Limay Vice Mayor Richie David said a salvage operation would be started once the weather conditions improved.
He cautioned residents against fishing because oil spills could occur during the operation.
Bataan Gov. Joet Garcia assured residents that the local government was working to prevent an oil spill.
Jochele Magracia, a resident of Limay’s Barangay Lamao and chair of Young Bataeños for Environment Advocacy Network (YoungBEAN), said they were worried about the livelihood of their community.
In Lamao alone, hundreds of fishermen would be affected by an oil spill. These numbers do not include others in the province who also rely on the sea for their livelihood.
“The impact of the typhoon continues on our community. For several days, the fishermen couldn’t venture to fish because of the strong waves caused by the typhoon, and the houses here were also flooded and it became even more painful because we heard that there was an oil spill here,” said Magracia.
Environmentalist Derek Cabe said what happened was an “additional disaster waiting to devastate the marine resources and the very source of food and livelihood of the community.”
“This is the reason why we should demand accountability from the corporations and the authorities that allowed the ship to sail despite the typhoon,” said Cabe, who is a coordinator of the Nuclear/Coal-Free Bataan Movement.

Julius Victor Degala, head of the Bulacan Provincial Environment and Natural Resources Office (Benro), said seafood and aquaculture products sold in Bulacan’s coastal towns tested negative for oil contamination based on informal sensory evaluations.
READ: Two-week delay seen in siphoning of oil from sunken tanker
Despite the safety assurance, Degala said there has been a noticeable decline in the demand and consumption of fish and seafood, likely due to public concern following news of the oil spill.
On Aug. 8, around 30 personnel from Benro, the Provincial Disaster Risk Reduction Management Office (PDRRMO), the Provincial Agriculture Office, and market masters inspected the fish stalls at the public markets in the towns of Hagonoy, Paombong, Bulakan, and Obando and Malolos City.
These agencies are part of the Bulacan Incident Management Team created by Gov. Daniel Fernando to monitor if the oil spill would affect the province.
“Based on the technical team’s findings, there is a general concern among the public about consuming fish and seafood, despite no confirmed reports of the oil spill affecting the province,” Degala noted in an interagency meeting at Hiyas Pavilion in this city on Aug. 9.

Wilfredo Cruz, Central Luzon director of the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources, also led a sensory evaluation on Aug. 1 and confirmed no traces of oil were found in fish and seafood sold in Bulacan. To demonstrate the safety of Bulacan’s seafood, Cruz and local officials took part in a boodle fight featuring “bangus” on the same day.
The Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) initially projected the oil spill would move southwards and affect coastal areas along Manila Bay in the provinces of Pampanga, Bulacan and Cavite and Malabon City in the National Capital Region.
Seafood sold in the towns of Hagonoy, Paombong, Bulakan, Obando and Malolos City—areas initially thought to be in the path of the spill—were typically sourced from Malabon, Hagonoy, Malolos City and Pampanga.
As of last week, however, the impact of the spill from Terranova, which was carrying 1.4 million liters of industrial fuel when it sank off Limay town in Bataan, was not as widespread as feared. So far, only Cavite’s coastal areas suffered from its impact.
Lt. Commander Michael Encina, the PCG’s spokesperson, reported during a National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council emergency meeting on July 29 that the oil leak from Terranova had significantly decreased, with the amount of spilled oil expected to dissipate naturally.
But the demand for fish in Bulacan continued to decline, forcing vendors to reduce their prices, Degala said.
He said they recommended an information drive to “reassure the public that Bulacan’s seafood is free from oil contamination.”
PDRRMO chief Manuel Lukban Jr. added that some retailers agreed that local suppliers should work to dispel misinformation about the oil spill.
Mar Trillana, a fishpond operator in Hagonoy, reported that daily sales of cultured bangus (milkfish) and tilapia raised in local fishponds and not in Manila Bay saw a 65-percent drop, from 50 tons to just 15 tons.
Fish vendor Jocelyn Lomotan, 61, lamented the “sluggish” sale at her stall at the Malolos City public market for the last three weeks, while Norma David, a fish dealer in Malabon, said her regular customers stopped coming to her stall in Sta. Maria town following the news of the oil spill.

But while others have reduced their prices, vendor Eleonor Garcia of Bulakan town said they maintained regular prices of bangus at P150-P180 per kilo and “galunggong” at P200 per kilo because “if prices are lowered, people might think the oil spill is real.”

MANILA, Philippines – Cavite Gov. Jonvic Remulla alerted coastal communities on Monday following reports that oil leaking from tanker Terra Nova, which sank off Bataan on July 25, had reached parts of the province, particularly Ternate, Maragondon, Naic and Tanza.
“It (the oil spill) was felt slightly early this morning. [We’re on our way] to [assist the affected villagers],” Remulla said.
According to fisherfolk group Pamalakaya, coastal residents of Tanza woke up to the “distinctive odor associated with the oil spill” on Sunday morning.
READ: PH Coast Guard battles Bataan oil spill mess with coconut husk boom
“Our worst fear has happened; the oil has spread throughout the vast Manila Bay and has disrupted the livelihood of many fishermen,” Pamalakaya vice chair Ronnel Arambulo said in a statement.
Fishermen were worried that the oil slick might contaminate fishery resources and affect the farm-gate prices of their catch, he added.
The group estimated that in Tanza alone, over 5,000 fisherfolk would be affected if the spill could not be immediately contained.
The Philippine Coast Guard (PCG), for its part, said that divers had sealed most of the sunken tanker’s leaking valves and were capping off even those that remained intact before siphoning operations could begin.
“We are hoping to seal all 24 valves today (July 29). We’re conducting the final mobilization of the siphoning equipment,” PCG Bataan Station commander Lt. Cmdr. Michael John Encina said in a press briefing. As of Monday afternoon, there were monitored leaks at one liter per hour, which he considered as “minimal.”
Terra Nova was carrying 1.4 million liters of industrial fuel oil when it sank amid stormy weather off Bataan on July 25, killing a crew member.
Around 300,000 liters of oil would be siphoned from the tanker and transferred to MT Helena Marie, the ship’s sister vessel.
“The moment that we lift the vessel and bring it adjacent to the shore, we can say it’s all under control,” Encina said.
The PCG earlier warned of an “environmental catastrophe” if the entire cargo leaked.
According to Encina, the siphoning operation will take five to seven days, 10 days being the longest. An estimated 50,000 liters per day will be taken out of the tanker.
The oil sheen monitored where the vessel sank has been reduced to 2 to 4 nautical miles from the stretch of 12 to 14 kilometers, he said.
At the same time, he said they were still verifying reports that the oil spill had reached the coastlines of Cavite and Bataan.
Environmental group Greenpeace earlier released photos and videos showing that an oil sheen had reached Hagonoy, Bulacan.
Meanwhile, all leaks found on another sunken motor tanker, Jason Bradley, have been sealed.
“The tanker carried 5.5 tons of diesel cargo, which had already been emptied. The mere fact that it’s diesel means it is easy to dissipate,” Encina said.
But the PCG is preparing charges against the owner of the tanker for not reporting the incident immediately when it sank on July 23 due to bad weather, two days before Terra Nova capsized. The six crew members onboard the Jason Bradley were rescued by another vessel, he added.

When asked how much the estimated cost was, Remulla replied: “P12 million for the last 12 days and running.”
The governor said they were estimating a compensation of P350 a day multiplied by the number of days that the fisherfolk, market vendors and shellfish cage caretakers will be displaced.
“We are well documented on who was affected in Cavite,” he added.
In a separate brief radio interview, Remulla emphasized what transpired during the meeting.
“Wala kaming aregluhan, wala kaming usapan. Kung merong pananagutang kriminal sa nangyari sa Terranova ay mananagot sila (There was no settlement, we didn’t talk about that. If there is criminal liability in what happened with Terranova, they will be held accountable),” he said.
MT Terranova, owned by Shogun Ships Co. Inc. sank in the waters off Limay town in Bataan on July 25, with 1.4 million liters of industrial fuel on board, during the onslaught of Supertyphoon Carina (international name: Gaemi).
The vessel was chartered to carry the fuel from Limay to Iloilo City by SL Harbor Bulk Terminal Corp., a subsidiary of San Miguel Corp., the largest conglomerate in the country.
The Philippine Coast Guard has reported that the oil that leaked from the tanker has spread across the waters off provinces surrounding Manila Bay, including Cavite, adding that it has been working round the clock to contain the spill.
However, during the media interview, Remulla reported that the oil sheen in the coastal areas of Cavite has started to disappear.
On Saturday, Remulla announced they would file criminal charges against the Terranova owner for the affected residents to claim damages for what happened to the coastal areas in Cavite.
Remulla on Tuesday explained that the filing of cases would depend on the findings of the Department of Justice.
He said they have yet to file the complaints.
“Because the process has just begun. But we are cooperating, and we are in touch,” Remulla said.
Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla recently announced that a class suit was being eyed against those responsible for the three recent maritime mishaps in Bataan.
He said the authorities were looking into the angle of the criminal cases against the owners, and others who may be responsible for maritime tragedies.
After the sinking of Terranova, another tanker, the MTKR Jason Bradley, also capsized due to bad weather in the waters off Bataan on July 27.
Four days later, another vessel, the MV Mirola 1, which was carrying diesel oil, ran aground in shallow waters off the coast of Bataan’s Mariveles town, causing the ship to tip over.
The Cavite provincial government on Wednesday declared a state of calamity in the cities of Cavite and Bacoor, and the towns of Noveleta, Rosario, Kawit, Tanza, Naic, Maragondon and Ternate affected by Terranova’s oil spill.

MANILA, Philippines – The Senate inquiry on the massive oil spill caused by the ill-fated MT Terranova will push through on Aug. 13, Senate Majority Leader Francis Tolentino announced on Wednesday.
Tolentino earlier filed a resolution to investigate the cause of the oil spill that affected around 46,000 fisherfolk, marine biodiversity, and food security in Bataan, Cavite, Metro Manila, and nearby areas.
“We need to set up stricter mechanisms to prevent such incidents, and to improve our capability to immediately respond to contain, clean up, and mitigate the impact of this toxic substance on the fishing sector and the environment,” Tolentino said in a news release, citing similar occurrences in Pola, Oriental Mindoro in 2023, and the island-province of Guimaras in 2006.
Tolentino also urged the Department of Agriculture (DA) to collaborate with other agencies to support fish vendors who are affected by the lower catch and subsequent fishing bans due to the oil spill.
READ: Cavite gov’t readies suit vs sunken tanker owner
“We must not forget the fish vendors. The government must also reach out to them because we have interviewed sellers in public markets who said that many stalls selling fish have now been closed,” the senator told DA Assistant Secretary Arnel De Mesa in his radio program.
In response, De Mesa assured the DA will work with the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) and the Department of Trade Industry (DTI) to assist fish vendors.
The Philippine Coast Guard is currently receiving assistance from the United States Coast Guard and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to contain the spill.
The DA, through the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR), has also started extending fuel subsidies to affected fisherfolk.

CITY OF SAN FERNANDO — The Pampanga provincial government has laid out 780 meters of floating booms made out of coconut waste products and plastic bottles to stop the seepage of fuel oil that has spilled from a motor tanker that sank about 30 kilometers from Limay in Bataan on July 24.
At least 57 booms at a length of 342 meters were placed at the mouth of the Batang Dos River, an official of the Pampanga Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (PDRRMC) said in a report.
Twenty more booms spanning 120 meters on the Baruya River, 32 booms extending 192 meters on Bancal Pugad, and 21 booms covering 126 meters on the Mabuanbuan River had been secured on bamboo stacks, according to PDRRMC officer Angelina Blanco.
Using coconut husks donated by Batangas and Quezon provinces and shredded hair, Pampanga has produced 1,822 booms as of Aug. 12, according to Art Punsalan, head of the provincial government environment and natural resources offices.
Blanco did not cite laboratory results of water and air samples. Still, an Inquirer source who showed an Environmental Management Bureau’s Aug. 12 report said six stations recorded “within standard” findings.
The PDRRMC, chaired by Gov. Dennis Pineda, projected the directly affected fisherfolk at 21,621 in 93 villages in the coastal towns of Guagua, Lubao, Macabebe, Masantol, Minalin, and Sasmuan.
Pineda said they are fishermen, fishpond operators or owners, workers, vendors, and boatmen.  On Tuesday, a big fishpond owner in Minalin was in a wait-and-see mode rather than opting for an early harvest.
“The oil slick has not reached Pampanga waters yet, and the dikes are protecting the [inland] ponds. Many of us have managed the volume of tilapia we sell to buyers who pick up their daily supplies. So far, business is still safe, said the trader. INQ

LUCENA CITY, QUEZON, Philippines — The provincial government of Cavite and other agencies have begun providing assistance to fisherfolk affected by the oil spill from a tanker that sank on July 25 in the waters off Bataan.
On Saturday, the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) of the Department of Agriculture distributed food packs to 1,612 fishermen in Noveleta town who had been registered for government assistance.
“Today’s distribution is just the beginning of our comprehensive relief and recovery plan for the affected fisherfolk of Cavite,” BFAR officer-in-charge Isidro Velayo Jr. was quoted as saying in a social media post by the agency’s Calabarzon office.

“We are committed to providing continuous support and working closely with local communities to restore their livelihoods and ensure sustainable recovery,” he added.
Velayo also said livelihood restoration initiatives and environmental rehabilitation efforts, were being planned and would be carried out in the coming weeks.
The Cavite government said it began providing food packages on Thursday, with 2,196 beneficiaries in Cavite City receiving the aid that day and another 2,867 on Friday.
Affected residents in the municipalities of Kawit and Rosario town also received food assistance.
MT Terranova, which was carrying 1.4 million liters of industrial fuel, sank off the waters of Limay town in Bataan on July 25, during the onslaught of Supertyphoon “Carina” (international name: Gaemi)
The Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) reported that the oil from the tanker spread across the waters of other provinces surrounding Manila Bay, including Cavite.
On Wednesday, the provincial government declared a state of calamity in two cities and nine towns—Cavite City and Bacoor City, and the municipalities of Noveleta, Rosario, Kawit, Tanza, Naic, Maragondon and Ternate.
A declaration of a state of calamity allows the concerned local governments to quickly access emergency funds and implement relief operations for affected residents.
To protect the health and safety of the public, Cavite Gov. Jonvic Remulla prohibited the catching and selling of all marine products to prevent oil contamination.
According to the Calabarzon Regional Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (RDRRMC), an estimated 352,179 residents in the coastal barangays of Cavite were affected by the oil spill.
Some “25,145 fisherfolks were also affected with an estimated loss of income amounting to P17,952,775 per day and predictably in 22 days, a total of P394,961,064,” the RDRRMC said in a report.
The Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) on Saturday said it would pursue a full probe on the July 25 sinking of the Terranova and of the MT Jason Bradley two days later also in Bataan.
“But for now, we are focused on our mission, which is to prevent [the further spread of the] oil spill,” Interior Secretary Benhur Abalos said at a press conference on Saturday.
He said the DILG is coordinating with the PCG in containing the oil spill, after it had confirmed that oil continues to leak from the Terranova at a rate of 1 liter per hour.

MANILA, Philippines — Authorities are moving to contain the ensuing oil spill from the submerged Motor Tanker (MT) Terra Nova at the portion of Manila Bay off Limay municipality in Bataan province.
Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) spokesperson Rear Admiral Armand Balilo said Thursday that if all 1.4 million liters of fuel the vessel was carrying would seep into the sea, the oil spill may reach the shores of the country’s capital, Manila, and be the worst oil spill in the country’s history.
Currently, Balilo said that only the “working fuel” of the ship or the fuel being used by the vessel to run has leaked. He added that the working fuel spill was only “minimal.”

MT Terra Nova was en route to Iloilo to deliver the fuel when it “capsized and eventually submerged” east of Lamao Point in Limay municipality at around 1:10 a.m. on Thursday.
“Of course, there is a big danger that Manila would be affected, even the shorelines of Manila because it is within Manila Bay,” Balilo said in an online briefing when asked what would happen if all 1.4 million liters of fuel [spilled] into the sea. He noted that their contingency plan includes such a worst-case situation.
“So far, the oil spill is minimal; probably, it’s the fuel used by the ship,” Balilo also said.“I have no details as to how much is the working fuel, but it’s very minimal.”
Balilo said the PCG’s marine environmental protection personnel have also been mobilized to prevent an oil slick.

The PCG dispatched personnel to Navotas, Bulacan, and Pampanga “to monitor and prepare for a possible oil spill,” following the sinking of the Philippine-flagged MT Terra Nova. Meanwhile, its BRP Melchora Aquino has been deployed to conduct search and rescue operations.
Balilo said 16 of the 17 crew on board had been rescued and PCG personnel aboard the vessel continued to look for the missing crew member.
The biggest oil spill in the country’s history thus far happened on February 28, 2023, when MT Princess Empress, carrying 800,000 liters of industrial fuel, sank off Naujan, Oriental Mindoro.
The clearing of oil slicks, which reached as far as Palawan and Verde Island Passage shores in Batangas, took a few months. Thousands of fishermen also lost their livelihood due to the incident.
The Office of Civil Defense said before that the government shelled out almost P1 billion to respond to the Mindoro oil spill.
Balilo said that if all 1.4 liters of industrial fuel carried by MT Terra Nova leaked, it would beat the Oriental Mindoro incident and become the worst oil spill in the country’s history.

Speaking to oil spill-hit residents of Navotas, Marcos said authorities are determining whether the motor tankers that sank last July are into smuggling.
“With regard to the investigation, we continue to look for an answer to the question: are these vessels involved in oil smuggling?” Marcos said.
“Why did the two vessels sail into our seas even if they are not registered?” he added.
In a statement, the Presidential Communications Office (PCO) quoted Marcos as saying that heads would roll among government officials involved in the oil spill.
Earlier this month, Justice Undersecretary Raul Vasquez told a news forum in Quezon City that authorities had noticed “red flags” in the oil spill that involved MT Jason Bradley, MV Mirola 1 and MT Terra Nova.
According to him, Jason Bradley has a pending case on oil smuggling at the justice department. Jason Bradley and Mirola 1 were also unregistered. Vasquez also pointed out that MT Terranova sailed for 26 hours but travelled a distance of only three nautical miles.
Valves from Terra Nova have been sealed, while the containment of oil leakage has been successful so far, the PCO said in a statement. More than 1.38 million liters of oil were collected from the vessel between Aug. 19 and Sept. 10.
Some 1.22 million liters of oil had been transported to a waste management facility in Marilao, Bulacan, for proper disposal as of Sept. 6. The contracted salvor for Jason Bradley has mobilized its pumps and has begun installing siphoning pipes. Mirola, meanwhile, was moored at a shipyard in Mariveles.
Marcos provided nearly P65.2 million in financial aid to 8,693 fisherfolk and their families in Navotas City who were affected by the oil spill. Each of the beneficiaries was supposed to receive P5,000 but the President increased the amount to P7,500.
The Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources also carried out livelihood interventions like the distribution of post-harvest materials, capacity-building, replacement of nets for mussel culture, Kadiwa program and fuel subsidies.

The province declared a state of calamity last July 24 due to the combined effects of Super Typhoon Carina (International name: Gaemi) and the southwest monsoon. 
“Ang pangalawang State of Calamity ay lubhang kinakailangan dahil sa mga panibagong pinsalang nararanasan ng may mahigit 17,000 mangingisdang taga-Bataan,” Bataan Governor Joet Garcia said on Monday night. 
(A second State of Calamity is sorely needed because of the new calamity we experienced that could affect 17,000 fisherfolk from Bataan.) 
Garcia said that the oil observed in the municipalities of Limay, Mariveles and Bagac are dangerous to aquatic resources. The communities also rely on these resources 
Citing data from the Department of Social Welfare and Development, Garcia said that 10,174 families in Limay and 4,822 families in Mariveles have already been impacted by the oil spill. 
“Sa ilalim ng pangalawang State of Calamity, magkakaroon ng karagdagang pondo ang lalawigan upang mabisang makapagpatupad ng mga hakbangin sa pagsugpo ng pinsalang dala ng oil spill at upang makapagbigay ng agarang tulong at serbisyo sa mga apektadong residente,” Garcia added.

Prior to Bataan, eight towns in Cavite were already placed under a state of calamity due to the oil spill. The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council’s latest situational report counts that 21 cities and municipalities have been placed under a state of calamity.  
The Terranova, which carried 1.5 million liters of oil, sank in the waters of Bataan on July 24 amid rough seas caused by Carina. Two other leaking vessels were later found in Bataan waters, causing the authorities to consider the possibility of oil smuggling.

Authorities have been combating the oil spill caused by the sunken MTKR Terranova as they attempt to prevent a widespread environmental catastrophe. However, traces of oil have already reached the shores of Bulacan and Cavite, with some reporting oil sheens in Metro Manila as well.  
“I received a message that a seven man team from the US Coast Guard will be arriving this weekend. And they are going to the ground zero probably on August 5,” Balilo said in a press briefing. 
According to the PCG spokesperson, the team will have personnel from the US Coast Guard’s Marine Environmental Protection Team, including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). 
However, Balilo said that they are not necessarily there to hasten up the oil spill mitigation efforts, but they could lend their expertise on the aftermath. 
“They will lend their expertise siguro 'yung aftermath ng oil spill, 'yung coastal management,” Balilo said. 
A total of three vessels have run into trouble in the waters of Bataan. The MTKR Terranova, which threatens to spill 1.4 million liters of oil into Philippine waters, has necessitated the PCG’s immediate attention. The MT Jason Bradley also sank in the waters of Bataan, but carried less oil than the MTKR Terranova. 
PCG Bataan Station commander Lieutenant Commander Michael John Encina said that salvage operations for the MT Jason Bradley were being mobilized, with tugboats siphoning 5,500 liters of oil from the sunken ship.  
Authorities have yet to begin siphoning the oil from the MTKR Terranova, as they still need to cover the ship’s leaking valves.  
A third vessel also faced issues in Bataan waters, but this time it only ran aground.The PCG said that the MV Mirola Uno is not a cause for concern, adding that it is focused on addressing the MTKR Terranova.

""As we see from this image it has spread quite quickly towards the Bulacan area,"" the Environment Secretary said.
 
Meanwhile, a UP Marine Science Institute model run of the spill based from the Philippine Space Agency (PhilSA) showed that the coastlines of Bulacan will be affected ""if the weather conditions continue,"" Yulo-Loyzaga said.

The DENR has already conducted anticipatory action to monitor changes in NCR, Regions 3 and 4-A to anticipate possible change in the trajectory of the oil spill.
Marcos, with advice from the DENR, has ordered the provincial governments that will possibly be affected to install organic spill booms along coastal areas to prevent the spread of oil spill.

According to a ""24 Oras"" report by Mark Salazar on Tuesday, oil slick samples have already been collected at Tanza, Cavite.
The University of the Philippines Marine Science Institute estimated the leakage to reach Cavite shores by Monday and Metro Manila by Tuesday.
If left uncontrolled, the oil spill may affect over 46,000 fishermen in Central Luzon, Region 4A, and National Capital Region.
Despite this, some fishermen said they have not seen any signs of an oil spill.
“Kung meron yan [na oil spill], siguradong pati kami matataranta. Kawawa ang hanapbuhay namin niyan,” said fisherman Julius Rodriguez.
(If there was [an oil spill], we would be in panic. Our livelihood would be at stake)

(As of now, not yet. The sales [of oysters] are still alright as the seas are still clear here)
The Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources has not implemented a fishing ban as leaking valves were immediately closed and the spill was contained.
In a virtual press conference by the Philippine Coast Guard on Tuesday afternoon, it was disclosed that oil siphoning in the area has been postponed as only 18 out of the 24 leaking valves of the MT Terra Nova had been sealed.
“Nasa local government units na ang pagpapasya kung magdedeklara sila [ng fishing ban]. Ang mandato po ngayon ng BFAR ay siguraduhin na patuloy ang assessment at evaluation patungkol dun sa kaligtasan sa pagkonsumo ng isda doon sa mga apektadong lugar,” said BFAR spokesperson Nazario Briguera.
(The local government units will decide if they will declare [a fishing ban]. The current mandate of the BFAR is to ensure continuous assessment and evaluation regarding the safety of fish consumption in affected areas)
Meanwhile, experts say that the oil spill had reportedly begun to affect marine life in Manila Bay.
“I can say dito, sa Manila Bay, meron pa rin siyang mga coral reef areas diyan sa may mouth [at sa] may Corregidor, Mariveles area, and meron na ring sightings na umabot na rin doon [ang spillage]. Hindi namin alam kung gaano kalala ang impact doon.

BFAR added that while the oil spill is under control, a clean-up operation would have to be conducted for the affected nearby shores.
“Kapag magiging bahagi tayo ng clean-up, dapat may protective equipment po tayo. Wag po basta basta magkakaroon ng contact dun sa oil slick kasi yung amoy nito, lalo na dun sa mga asthmatic, pwedeng makaapekto,” said Briguera.

According to Balilo, the oil that was traced was probably the working fuel of the motor tanker and not part of the 1.4 million liters of industrial fuel stored in it.
“Probably ito yung fuel na ginagamit ng barko. Yung karga, wala pang signs na tumatagas na,” he told reporters in a virtual interview.
(This was probably the working fuel used of the ship. There are no signs that the industrial oil on storage is leaking yet.)
“Yun ang magiging goal natin na malaman kung tatagas based doon sa plan ng barko. Malalaman natin kung gaano ka-secure yung water integrity ng mga tanks niya,” he added.
(That will be our goal, to know if there will be a leak based on the ship's plan. We will know secure the tank is.)
The PCG said that ""there was no weather disturbance in the vicinity waters when the maritime incident occurred.""
PCG’s BRP Melchora Aquino launched search and rescue operations for the one missing crew.
“PCG Commandant, CG Admiral Ronnie Gil L Gavan, has ordered the conduct of an investigation regarding the maritime incident,” the PCG said.
The PCG is now coordinating with oil spill response organizations to help contain the spill.
The agency aims to retrieve the remaining oil inside the tanker in a span of seven days.
Huge waves
Balilo said that based on the initial account of rescued crew members huge waves hit and filled the motor tanker. 
“Umalis sila doon sa Bataan papunta ng Iloilo. Pero during that time bandang mga alas 10 ng gabi, naramdaman na nila na malakas na yung alon,” he told reporters.
(They departed Bataan for Iloilo. But  around 10 o'clock in the evening, they felt that the waves were getting stronger.)
“Nag-decide yung kapitan na bumalik pero initially nahirapan sila sapagkat ang sabi nila pasalubong sila doon sa alon. Ang term ng mga crew ay sumalok sila ng alon at pinasok yung barko hanggang tuluyan silang nag-capsize,” he added.

It includes the tanker's location as well as a satellite image of the oil leak that was taken at 5:40 a.m., PhilSA said, adding that the slick covers an area of 14.4 square kilometers.
 
The image was retrieved from the International Charter Space and Major Disasters, which provides Earth-observation satellite data to support disaster management efforts.
''Please be advised that this map is still subject to field validation,'' PhilSA said.
The MT Terra Nova departed Bataan for Iloilo when it capsized 3.6 nautical miles east off Limay town around 1:10 a.m. Thursday.
According to the Philippine Coast Guard, 16 of the 17 crew members were rescued, while one crewman was found dead.
On Friday, the PCG said it started collecting oil to counter the spread of the spill.
''There are oil spill booms in the area, there are dispersants, and there are environmental protection personnel,'' PCG spokesperson Rear Admiral Armand Balilo told reporters.
Balilo said that the oil spill was coming from the working fuel of the motor tanker and not from the 1.4 million liters of stored industrial oil.
In a worst-case scenario in which the cargo of 1.4 million liters of industrial oil leaked from the motor tanker, Balilo said the waters of Parañaque, Manila, Navotas, Bulacan, and Pampanga would be affected.

AFP journalists at the Port of Limay in Bataan province watched Coast Guard personnel preparing equipment for a boat to be used against the slick in Manila Bay.
The MT Terra Nova sank in rough seas nearly seven kilometers (4.3 miles) off Limay municipality early Thursday after setting out for the central city of Iloilo.
An oil slick stretching several kilometers has been detected in the waterway, which thousands of fishermen and tourism operators rely on for their livelihoods.
But Coast Guard spokesman Rear Admiral Armando Balilo told a briefing Thursday that it appeared diesel fuel used to power the tanker had leaked and, so far, not the industrial fuel oil cargo.
The Coast Guard has set a target of seven days to offload the cargo and prevent what Balilo warned would be the worst oil spill in Philippine history if it were to leak.
The incident happened as heavy rains fueled by Super Typhoon Carina and the seasonal monsoon lashed Manila and surrounding regions in recent days.
Swamped by waves
After setting out late Wednesday the captain decided to abort the journey to Iloilo due to rough seas, but as the vessel turned back it was swamped by large waves and went down.
One crew member died, but 16 were rescued.
An investigation into the cause of the incident was underway but Balilo said Thursday the vessel had not broken rules on heavy-weather sailing.
Campaign group Greenpeace said the owners of MT Terra Nova should ""foot the bill"" for any environmental damage and compensate affected communities.
One of the worst oil spills in the Philippines was in February 2023, when a tanker carrying 800,000 liters of industrial fuel oil sank off the central island of Mindoro.
Diesel fuel and thick oil from that vessel contaminated the waters and beaches along the coast of Oriental Mindoro province, devastating the fishing and tourism industries.
The oil dispersed over hundreds of kilometers of waters famed for having some of the most diverse marine life in the world.
A tanker sank off the central island of Guimaras in 2006, spilling tens of thousands of gallons of oil that destroyed a marine reserve, ruined local fishing grounds and covered stretches of coastline in black sludge.
Immediate action sought
Meanwhile, fishers’ group Pambansang Lakas ng Kilusang Mamamalakaya ng Pilipinas (PAMALAKAYA) raised alarm over the incident and urged for the “immediate and appropriate measures” to contain the oil spill and its possible impact. 
“We are highly alarmed that this maritime incident could cause a massive oil spill in Manila Bay, affecting both the marine environment and socio-economic activities of fisherfolk… We can’t afford another ecological disaster if this oil spill escalates across our fishing grounds,” said PAMALAKAYA Vice Chairperson  Ronnel Arambulo said in a statement.
“We demand immediate and appropriate measures to contain this looming ecological disaster. The government should have a contingency plan for the potential impacts of the oil spill to marine and fishery resources,” Arambulo added. 
Arambulo said the oil spill should be prevented from reaching the 7.5-hectare fish sanctuary located in a coastal village in Limay, Bataan. It is also said the owner of MT Terra Nova should pay compensatory damages and shoulder the cleanup costs of the oil spill.  — with Sundy Mae Locus/Agence France-Presse

""I will direct... the Civil Defense will take the lead here. You put the teams together from the DENR, the Coast Guard will have their part,""  Marcos said.
Marcos meanwhile ordered the PCG to assess the MT Terra Nova's condition while the DILG would coordinate the LGU units' response.
""DILG of course, you will have to coordinate with the local executives to make sure that coordinated ang galaw natin,"" he said.
The DENR's role in the task force is to conduct water and air quality tests in the affected area, while the DOH monitors Bataan residents' health and medical conditions.
The DOLE would deliver livelihood programs for affected residents, and the DSWD would aid victims.
In the same briefing, Marcos, with advice from the DENR, ordered the provincial governments that could be affected to install organic spill booms along coastal areas to prevent the oil spill from spreading.
""We will anticipate already the effects on the coastal  areas, what they will need in terms of assistance. We can use the  TUPAD... 'yun ang immediate concern natin, is to have those booms made  from indigenous materials, we have to deploy them as quickly as  possible.""

“There are so many red flags dito [in this incident],” DOJ Undersecretary Raul Vasquez said at the Saturday News Forum in Quezon City.
On Friday, Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla said the DOJ is eyeing the filing of a class suit against those responsible for the oil spill.
Remulla also said that all three vessels were “interconnected,” but did not elaborate.
Pressed to explain what the Justice chief meant when he said that the vessels involved in the incident were interconnected, Vasquez said, “‘Yan ang sinasabi kong red flag, pare-parehas na magkakadikit (That’s the red flag I’ve been talking about, they are all near each other).”
On July 25, the MT Terranova capsized and sank 3.6 nautical miles east off Lamao Point in Limay, Bataan, with one crew member reported to have died.
MT Terranova was carrying 1.4 million liters of industrial fuel.
Meanwhile, the MTKR Jason Bradley — another vessel that sank in the waters off Mariveles, Bataan on July 27 — was carrying 5,500 liters of diesel, and was also found to have leaks.
A third vessel, the MV Mirola 1, meanwhile, ran aground near the shore of Mariveles town. Oil was seen flowing into the ocean from tanks inside the motor vessel.
“I think, these are three to five nautical miles away from each other. We can draw a lot of conclusions from there,” Vasquez said.
Conspiracy?
Authorities are also questioning why the vessels sailed despite warnings of an upcoming typhoon, according to the DOJ official.
“Maraming mga question pero ayoko pa sabihin sa ngayon kasi ongoing pa ang fact-finding… Maybe it’s conspiracy, maybe… who knows?” Vasquez said.
Asked if the DOJ is looking at the angle of conspiracy in its ongoing investigation, he said, “Titignan natin malamang… kasi makikita mo may mga red flags (We'll look into it, of course… because there are red flags).”
GMA News Online has sought comment from the lawyer of Portvaga Ship Management Inc., which owns MV Terranova, but it has yet to reply as of posting time.
Meanwhile, Vasquez said the “admissions” from the crew of the involved vessels were also found to be red flags.
He questioned the number of hours that a certain vessel is at sea when its destination is much farther away.
“Nung nagtatanong kami… sinabi na ganito lang ‘yung nalayag niya, ilang oras na siya. Bakit? Papunta siyang Iloilo eh, bakit ganun lang? (When we asked… they said they've been out at sea for quite some time already and yet the ship has not moved that much.),” Vasquez said.
Intentional?
The DOJ official was also asked if the sinking of the vessels were intentional.

“As of today, 05 August 2024, the PCG recovered 790 liters of oil-water mixture and five sacks of contaminated oil debris using absorbent pads,” the PCG said in an update.
The PCG continues to conduct oil recovery and containment operations. It also monitors the oil spill booms in the concerned area.
On Thursday, oil recovery operations started for MV Mirola 1, which ran aground in the vicinity waters of Sitio Quiapo, Barangay Biaan, Mariveles, Bataan on July 31.
Aside from MV Mirola 1, the PCG is also responding to the oil spill from MTKR Terranova with 1.4 million liters of industrial fuel oil and MTKR Jason Bradley with 5,500 liters of diesel.
Initial cappings have sealed the valves of MTKR Terranova but presence of very thin oil sheens were still observed in the ground zero, according to PCG.
Oil spill booms are still being repositioned and maintained to control the leak, the PCG added.
On July 25, one crew member died and 16 others were rescued after MTKR Terranova capsized and sank 3.6 nautical miles east off Lamao Point in Limay, Bataan, according to the PCG.
The initial capping bags on the valves of the motor tanker will be replaced with metal caps to avoid a “disastrous oil spill” during the conduct of the siphoning operation.
According to the PCG, the fabrication of metal cappings will take seven days and their installation will take another seven days. 
“This week, the earlier attached seals made of special canvass capping bags will be replaced with a new set to avoid undue risks from wear and tear from its exposure to oil,” the PCG commandant Admiral Ronnie Gil Gavan said.
After the replacement with metal cappings, the siphoning operation may start.
Of the 1.4 million liters of industrial fuel oil, 300,000 liters need to be siphoned to float MTKR Terranova. This would take up to seven days, the PCG said. The motor tanker will then be moved to a shallow area.
Meanwhile, the PCG and contracted salvor FES Challenger Salvour and Builders continue with their salvage operations for MTKR Jason Bradley.
Divers prepare for pipe insertion by clearing debris.
Equipment and personnel are being prepared on the site and an operational base is being set up, according to the PCG.
On July 27, MTKR Jason Bradley sank in the vicinity waters of Barangay Cabcaben, Mariveles, Bataan.
The estimated cost of damage due to the oil spill that is affecting the areas of Cavite has reached P1 billion, according to the provincial government on Saturday.
A state of calamity was declared in nine coastal local government units in Cavite due to the oil spill incident from sunken motor tanker Terranova in Bataan, according to the Office Civil Defense Calabarzon.

Marine protection organization Oceana raised the alarm on the spill's harmful impact on the municipal waters of Limay and Mariveles in Bataan, and Tanza, Rosario, Noveleta, and Cavite City in Cavite. 
“The government should  immediately assess the effects of the oil spill on the marine environment, including fisheries, ensure that procedures and standards are set in motion and  investigate who are directly responsible for this maritime incident,” said Oceana vice president Estenzo Ramos in a statement. 
“Further, we need to make sure that laws are strictly enforced and  appropriate penalties are implemented,” she added. “Learning from the lessons of the oil spill in the Verde Island Passage, we need to study and craft measures such as  increasing the fines and other sanctions  based on the damages caused on the habitats, wildlife  and the people’s lives and livelihood.” 
One died after MT Terra Nova, which was en route to Iloilo from Bataan, capsized 3.6 nautical miles east off Lamao Point in Limay town around 1:10 a.m.
An oil spill was also monitored 5.6 nautical miles east off Lamao Point with an estimated coverage of two nautical miles, carried by a strong current heading east to northeast. 
Meanwhile, Greenpeace urged the government to  lessen its dependence on fossil fuels as the oil spill is like a “ticking time bomb” to the safety and livelihoods of those living in coastal areas. 
“We reiterate our call for the Marcos administration to end our dependence on fossil fuels, and expedite a just transition to renewable energy,” said Greenpeace in a statement. 
“President Marcos must also call for payment from fossil fuel companies for losses and damages suffered by Filipino communities, and immediately adopt a comprehensive Climate Justice Agenda as the country faces the worsening impacts of the climate crisis.” 
According to the Philippine Coast Guard, Oil Spill Response Organizations, oil companies, and local government units offered to extend help in oil spill response efforts. 
The last major oil spill incident in the Philippines was just in February 2023 when the MT Princess Empress, which was carrying 900,000 liters of industrial oil, sank off the coast of Naujan, Oriental Mindoro.

“Iyong technology kailangan pa nating i-improve kasi nga po may mga limitasyon, kasi nga iba-ibang klase ng oil,” said Hernando Bacosa, a professor at the Mindanao State University-Iligan Institute of Technology and the Department of Science and Technology's lead expert on oil spill, in a public briefing.
(We need to improve our technology because it has limitations in responding to different types of oil.)
Bacosa was referring to foam technology CocoFlexSorb, which is said to have the ability to absorb different types of oils, such as light, vegetable, kerosene, engine, and bunker oil.
However, the DOST said further testing and development needed to be done before the technology, developed by researchers from MSU-IIT, could be adopted and commercialized. 
“I think kailangan pa rin nating mag-develop noong mga material na gawa sa Pilipinas na magagamit natin kapag may darating na naman na oil spill,” he added.
(We need to develop materials that are made in the Philippines that can be used in future oil spill incidents.)
The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, meanwhile, lists oil spill booms and skimmers as two of the means used to contain oil spills.
Three vessels have been reported to be leaking environmentally harmful material off Bataan.
A motor vessel (MV) ran aground near the shore of Mariveles town on Wednesday.
Authorities discovered that oil from the tanks of MV Mirola 1 was spilling into the sea.
Three days prior, motor tanker (MT) Jason Bradley was discovered leaking diesel off the town's coast.
On July 25, a tanker sank off Limay town in Bataan amid heavy rains and rough seas, causing another oil spill.
The Philippine Coast Guard’s (PCG) salvage team was able to control the leakage of 1.4 million liters of industrial oil from the sunken MT Terranova. 
According to Bacosa, the oil spill in Limay is easier to manage because MT Terranova is only 30 meters deep, as opposed to MT Princess Empress, which was found 400 meters deep in Oriental Mindoro in 2023.“Ngayon it is under control, but still, nandun pa yung barko. Hanggat di natatanggal ang langis dun, meron pa rin threat sa ating environment. Dapat matanggal, siphone lahat ng langis,” Bacosa said.

PCG National Capital Region (NCR)-Central Luzon spokesperson Lieutenant Commander Michael John Encina said that their investigating team is identifying the real reason why the sunken MT Terranova, the MTKR Jason Bradley and MV Mirola were in waters off Bataan before the incidents happened.
Under the “paihi” system, oil from a large vessel is transferred to smaller crafts at sea to avoid paying taxes.
“Ang mga ganitong reports ay hindi namin dini-discount. We are carefully coordinating din po sa other agencies para tulungan tayo sa previous citations ng mga barkong ito,” Encina said in a Super Radyo dzBB interview.
(We do not discount such reports. We are also carefully coordinating with other agencies to help us know what are the previous citations of these ships.)

(Right now, the investigation is still ongoing. Once there is a result, we will present it to the public so we can be transparent about what actually caused the incidents.)
Justice Undersecretary Raul Vasquez said Saturday that the Department of Justice (DOJ) is looking into a possible ""conspiracy"" that might have led to the recent maritime disaster in Bataan involving three vessels that leaked thousands of liters of fuel into Manila Bay.
On Friday, Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla said the DOJ is eyeing the filing of a class suit against those responsible for the oil spill.
Remulla also said that all three vessels were “interconnected,” but did not elaborate.
Amid the investigation of the PCG’s Marine Casualty Investigation Team, Encina said that they will ensure that those responsible for the oil spill will not be able to get away.
“Kagaya ng sinabi ni Secretary [Benhur] Abalos, kung sino ang may kasalanan, ‘yun ay mananagot,” he added.

In an advisory, the DOH emphasized that oil spill may cause the following health effects depending on how an individual came in contact with the substance: 
To avoid these, the DOH advised that warning signs be put up in affected areas or near affected bodies of water. The public should also ensure that their drinking water and food are clean.
Children should also be prohibited from affected areas, as they usually play on the ground and are at higher risk of ingestion since they frequently put their hands in their mouths.
The DOH said when exposed to the oil spill or any chemical from the oil spill, the clothes should be removed and decontaminated. Exposed areas of the body should also be immediately washed with mild soap and water.
Those experiencing any symptoms from exposure to oil spill are urged to seek immediate medical assistance from the nearest health facility and healthcare professional. 
The DOH also reminded the public not to bathe, wash clothes, or wade in oil spill affected areas to avoid exposure to the oil and any chemicals used to control the spill. 
Even pets and farm animals should be barred from bathing or drinking from the affected water. 
The agency also asked the public not to eat seafood like fish and shellfish from affected areas and nearby water sources unless cleared by local authorities.
