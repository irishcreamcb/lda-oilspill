Speaking to oil spill-hit residents of Navotas, Marcos said authorities are determining whether the motor tankers that sank last July are into smuggling.
“With regard to the investigation, we continue to look for an answer to the question: are these vessels involved in oil smuggling?” Marcos said.
“Why did the two vessels sail into our seas even if they are not registered?” he added.
In a statement, the Presidential Communications Office (PCO) quoted Marcos as saying that heads would roll among government officials involved in the oil spill.
Earlier this month, Justice Undersecretary Raul Vasquez told a news forum in Quezon City that authorities had noticed “red flags” in the oil spill that involved MT Jason Bradley, MV Mirola 1 and MT Terra Nova.
According to him, Jason Bradley has a pending case on oil smuggling at the justice department. Jason Bradley and Mirola 1 were also unregistered. Vasquez also pointed out that MT Terranova sailed for 26 hours but travelled a distance of only three nautical miles.
Valves from Terra Nova have been sealed, while the containment of oil leakage has been successful so far, the PCO said in a statement. More than 1.38 million liters of oil were collected from the vessel between Aug. 19 and Sept. 10.
Some 1.22 million liters of oil had been transported to a waste management facility in Marilao, Bulacan, for proper disposal as of Sept. 6. The contracted salvor for Jason Bradley has mobilized its pumps and has begun installing siphoning pipes. Mirola, meanwhile, was moored at a shipyard in Mariveles.
Marcos provided nearly P65.2 million in financial aid to 8,693 fisherfolk and their families in Navotas City who were affected by the oil spill. Each of the beneficiaries was supposed to receive P5,000 but the President increased the amount to P7,500.
The Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources also carried out livelihood interventions like the distribution of post-harvest materials, capacity-building, replacement of nets for mussel culture, Kadiwa program and fuel subsidies.
The agency also distributed 50 sets of bottom-set gill nets and two units of fish processing utensils. The Office of Speaker Martin Romualdez, meanwhile, provided 10 kilograms of rice to each beneficiary.

The province declared a state of calamity last July 24 due to the combined effects of Super Typhoon Carina (International name: Gaemi) and the southwest monsoon. 
“Ang pangalawang State of Calamity ay lubhang kinakailangan dahil sa mga panibagong pinsalang nararanasan ng may mahigit 17,000 mangingisdang taga-Bataan,” Bataan Governor Joet Garcia said on Monday night. 
(A second State of Calamity is sorely needed because of the new calamity we experienced that could affect 17,000 fisherfolk from Bataan.) 
Garcia said that the oil observed in the municipalities of Limay, Mariveles and Bagac are dangerous to aquatic resources. The communities also rely on these resources 
Citing data from the Department of Social Welfare and Development, Garcia said that 10,174 families in Limay and 4,822 families in Mariveles have already been impacted by the oil spill. 
“Sa ilalim ng pangalawang State of Calamity, magkakaroon ng karagdagang pondo ang lalawigan upang mabisang makapagpatupad ng mga hakbangin sa pagsugpo ng pinsalang dala ng oil spill at upang makapagbigay ng agarang tulong at serbisyo sa mga apektadong residente,” Garcia added. 
(Under the second state of calamity, there will be additional funding in the province so that we can effectively take steps to address the calamities caused by the oil spill and so that we could give immediate help and service to affected residents.) 
Prior to Bataan, eight towns in Cavite were already placed under a state of calamity due to the oil spill. The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council’s latest situational report counts that 21 cities and municipalities have been placed under a state of calamity.  
The Terranova, which carried 1.5 million liters of oil, sank in the waters of Bataan on July 24 amid rough seas caused by Carina. Two other leaking vessels were later found in Bataan waters, causing the authorities to consider the possibility of oil smuggling.

Authorities have been combating the oil spill caused by the sunken MTKR Terranova as they attempt to prevent a widespread environmental catastrophe. However, traces of oil have already reached the shores of Bulacan and Cavite, with some reporting oil sheens in Metro Manila as well.  
“I received a message that a seven man team from the US Coast Guard will be arriving this weekend. And they are going to the ground zero probably on August 5,” Balilo said in a press briefing. 
According to the PCG spokesperson, the team will have personnel from the US Coast Guard’s Marine Environmental Protection Team, including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). 
However, Balilo said that they are not necessarily there to hasten up the oil spill mitigation efforts, but they could lend their expertise on the aftermath. 
“They will lend their expertise siguro 'yung aftermath ng oil spill, 'yung coastal management,” Balilo said. 
A total of three vessels have run into trouble in the waters of Bataan. The MTKR Terranova, which threatens to spill 1.4 million liters of oil into Philippine waters, has necessitated the PCG’s immediate attention. The MT Jason Bradley also sank in the waters of Bataan, but carried less oil than the MTKR Terranova. 
PCG Bataan Station commander Lieutenant Commander Michael John Encina said that salvage operations for the MT Jason Bradley were being mobilized, with tugboats siphoning 5,500 liters of oil from the sunken ship.  
Authorities have yet to begin siphoning the oil from the MTKR Terranova, as they still need to cover the ship’s leaking valves.  
A third vessel also faced issues in Bataan waters, but this time it only ran aground.The PCG said that the MV Mirola Uno is not a cause for concern, adding that it is focused on addressing the MTKR Terranova.
