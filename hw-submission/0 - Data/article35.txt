Fish from areas affected by the Bataan oil spill are now safe for human consumption, except those from Cavite, the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources said Tuesday. 
In a statement, BFAR said fish from Bataan, Bulacan, Pampanga, Batangas, Navotas, Paran?aque, and Las Pin?as are safe to eat. 
"In the province of Cavite, fish and shellfish samples collected are still not safe for human consumption based on sensory evaluation," it added.
BFAR said since the onset of the oil spill in Limay, Bataan, BFAR has been conducting on-ground monitoring and assessment of potentially affected fishing areas and communities surrounding Manila Bay.
It said fish samples are regularly collected and analyzed for traces of oil and grease and harmful contaminants polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH).
“These tests are important to ensure that fish caught in the potentially affected areas are free from contamination and safe for public consumption,” BFAR said.
It said fish from Batangas, particularly in Nasugbu, Lian, and Calatagan, were labelled safe based on testing on Aug. 9.
Meanwhile, samples from Bataan, Bulacan, and Pampanga have consistently shown no oil and grease contamination since August 12.
The agency noted low levels of concern for harmful contaminant polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), posing no risk to the health of consumers.
Fish and shellfish from Navotas, Manila, Paran?aque, and Las Piñas also yielded negative for contamination based on testing conducted on Jul. 31, Aug. 6, and Aug. 12.
BFAR said it will continue to conduct fish sampling, sensory evaluation, and PAH testing in affected areas to track the effects of the oil spill.
It also urged fisherfolk and the general public to remain calm and monitor the situation through updates issued by government authorities —Jiselle Anne Casucian/AOL, GMA Integrated News
