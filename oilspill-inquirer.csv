BATAAN, Philippines — The Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) planned Friday to deploy oil dispersant and floating barriers a day after a tanker carrying 1.4 million liters of industrial fuel sank off Limay municipality in this province.
Agence France-Presse journalists at the Port of Limay watched PCG personnel preparing equipment for a boat to be used against the slick in Manila Bay.
The MT Terra Nova sank in rough seas nearly seven kilometers (4.3 miles) off Limay municipality early Thursday after setting out for the central city of Iloilo.
An oil slick stretching several kilometers has been detected in the waterway, which thousands of fishermen and tourism operators rely on for their livelihoods.

But PCG spokesman Rear Admiral Armando Balilo told a briefing Thursday that it appeared diesel fuel used to power the tanker had leaked and, so far, not the industrial fuel oil cargo.
The PCG has set a target of seven days to offload the cargo and prevent what Balilo warned would be the worst oil spill in Philippine history if it were to leak.
The incident happened as heavy rains fueled by Typhoon Gaemi, locally named Carina, and the seasonal monsoon lashed Manila and surrounding regions early in the week.
After setting out late Wednesday, the captain decided to abort the journey to Iloilo due to rough seas, but as the vessel turned back it was swamped by large waves and went down.
One crew member died, but 16 were rescued.
An investigation into the cause of the incident was underway but Balilo said Thursday the vessel had not broken rules on heavy-weather sailing.
Campaign group Greenpeace said the owners of MT Terra Nova should “foot the bill” for any environmental damage and compensate affected communities.

One of the worst oil spills in the Philippines was in February 2023, when a tanker carrying 800,000 liters of industrial fuel oil sank off the central island of Mindoro.
Diesel fuel and thick oil from that vessel contaminated the waters and beaches along the coast of Oriental Mindoro province, devastating the fishing and tourism industries.
The oil dispersed over hundreds of kilometers of waters famed for having some of the most diverse marine life in the world.

It is but small comfort that only the “working fuel,” or the diesel fuel used to power MT Terra Nova, has leaked so far, and not the industrial fuel oil cargo. The vessel, headed for Iloilo, capsized and eventually submerged off Lamao Point, Limay, Bataan, right at the mouth of Manila Bay, early Thursday morning just as Supertyphoon “Carina” left devastation behind. As of Friday, reports said an oil slick stretching about 3.7 kilometers was being carried by a strong current. Authorities were worried that it would reach Manila Bay, and also affect Navotas, Bulacan, and Pampanga depending on the wind direction and sea currents.
The PCG has absolved MT Terra Nova from breaking any rules on heavy-weather sailing because, per its spokesperson Rear Admiral Armand Balilo, the weather bureau has not issued a typhoon signal over Bataan when it started to sail late Wednesday. The ship’s captain only decided to turn back when the vessel encountered large waves. By then, it was too late—one of the 17 crew members was later found dead.
The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical Services Administration, in fact, has issued regular weather bulletins on Carina and as early as Tuesday warned of rough seas over the northern and eastern seaboards of Northern Luzon and eastern seaboards of Central Luzon. Authorities must investigate the incident to determine accountability—were there other factors why the vessel left the port despite bad weather conditions?
But first, authorities must contain the spill and mobilize local and international support—the PCG has given itself seven days to complete the siphoning operations. That the ship sunk in a relatively shallow area could help contain the disaster and hasten salvage operations although this still depends on the kind of fuel used. Most ships use heavy fuel oil which spreads slower but is stickier and more difficult to clean up. Shogun Ships Company Inc., the ship’s owner, has tapped Harbor Star Shipping Services under a “no cure, no pay” contract, meaning, to get paid, the latter must fulfill the terms of agreement including minimizing possible environmental damage and salvaging the industrial fuel oil contained in the tanker.
Harbor Star was also one of the companies contracted for the shoreline cleanup and disposal of oily waste in last year’s oil spill involving MT Princess Empress. The oil tanker, carrying 900,000 liters of industrial oil, sunk off Naujan, Oriental Mindoro, on Feb. 28, 2023, on the way to Iloilo.
The spill eventually reached the coastal communities of Oriental Mindoro, Batangas, Antique, and Palawan, affecting 200,000 people across three regions, including 27,850 fisherfolk. It also affected the Verde Island Passage, an important area for marine biodiversity. The government estimated total damage to the ecosystem and dependent coastal communities at P5.1 billion but the Center for Energy, Ecology, and Development placed it at P41.2 billion.The damage in this most recent oil spill could be more extensive and the government must look into the Mindoro oil spill case and what it can do better this time. The top criticism was the delay in assisting fisherfolk and providing them with alternative sources of income. Local communities should also be assisted in responding to disasters like this as immediate response is crucial.
The country has several laws and regulations to prevent oil spills and hold companies accountable for their actions but enforcement and implementation remain problematic. The legal process can be complicated and time-consuming for fisherfolk and coastal communities, who do not have resources at their disposal, to pursue.
This should not be the norm, however, and the government must use the full extent of the law to make rich companies behind these disasters pay because the damage caused to the environment and the communities is permanent.
As Lea Guerrero, Greenpeace Philippines country director, said: “Even [if] an oil spill has been declared clear, there are portions of the sea which never really recover. A lot of the cleaning and the clearing that you see are the visible effect, the visible sign of the spill but a lot of it is happening under the water where the chemicals [affect] marine life … It’s not just the cleaning of the oil spill that we’re talking about [but] the compounding effects on communities that are reliant on a healthy marine environment.” Environmentalists also reiterated their call for the Marcos administration to end dependence on fossil fuels and expedite the transition to renewable energy.
Indeed, it is not enough to contain this latest disaster—the government must prevent future incidents from happening, as they always take a heavy toll on the environment and ordinary Filipinos.

MANILA, Philippines—As the oil spill from three sunken vessels — MT Terranova, MTKR Jason Bradley, and MV Mirola 1 — spreads across a significant portion of Manila Bay, contaminating the waters of Cavite, Bulacan, and Bataan, authorities are issuing urgent warnings about the severe health risks posed by exposure to this environmental disaster.
While the government, environmental organizations, and health authorities intensify their efforts to manage the escalating crisis, the public is strongly urged to take preventive measures.
An international ocean protection and conservation group further warned about how the toxic spill continues to pose a grave threat to the environment and the health and livelihood of communities in affected areas.
The series of maritime disasters began on July 25, 2024, when MT Terra Nova, a tanker carrying 1.4 million liters of industrial fuel oil, capsized off the coast of Limay, Bataan. The vessel, en route to Iloilo, sank while Typhoon Carina (Gaemi) ravaged Metro Manila and surrounding provinces.

Just two days later, on July 27, 2024, the MTKR Jason Bradley, which was anchored in the waters off Bataan, sank nine meters deep near Barangay Cabcaben in Mariveles — approximately 600 yards from the shore.
The vessel was carrying 5,500 liters of diesel when it sank during the onslaught of Super Typhoon Carina. Initially, the shipping company claimed that there was no fuel cargo onboard.

The latest incident occurred on July 31, 2024, when the MV Mirola 1 ran aground in shallow waters off the coast of Sitio Quiapo, Barangay Biaan — also in Mariveles — causing the ship to tip over.

According to Karagatan Patrol, an online platform created by the renowned marine conservation organization Oceana, it is estimated that the oil spill from the sunken vessels affects 50 percent of Manila Bay, with the pollution spreading to Cavite, Bulacan, and Bataan.
Manila Bay serves as a crucial spawning ground for fish like sardines, a key source of protein for millions of Filipinos.
Oceana warned that the oil spill threatens to smother and kill vital mangroves, coral reefs, and seagrass beds in the bay, which are essential for the breeding and feeding of marine species.
The bay also provides habitat for at least 60 migratory bird species, including 12 threatened ones, just as their migration season begins.
“The destruction of these habitats leads to long-term ecological damage for years to come and puts the coastal nation at further risk from increasing storms,” Oceana said.
The Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) began recovery operations for the MV Mirola 1 on August 1. Photos shared on the PCG’s official Facebook page showed personnel manually collecting the oil inside the vessel.
The PCG said the collected oil was carefully placed into large drums, which were then prepared for transport to a waste disposal facility to prevent any potential health hazards to local residents.

Additionally, on August 7, the PCG took part in a simulation exercise at Lamao Port in Limay, Bataan. This drill was described as a crucial part of the ongoing siphoning operation for the MTKR Terranova.
“We learned that heavy fuel oil flows when siphoned and confirmed the necessity of hot tapping each tank to prevent water mixing,” said Harbor Star Shipping Services Inc., the salvor contracted for the cleanup.
“This process is time-consuming due to water depth and divers’ 25-minute limits. With these insights, we can establish a timeline by Friday,”it said.
Oceana has reported that traces of oil have already been detected in fishing villages in the provinces of Bulacan and Cavite. In Cavite, the Ternate Marine Park, a popular beach destination and a nesting ground for sea turtles, is also feared to be affected by the spill.

Eight towns in Cavite—Bacoor, Kawit, Noveleta, Rosario, Tanza, Naic, Maragondon, and Ternate— have already declared a “state of calamity.”
Under the Philippine Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act, a state of calamity is defined as “a condition involving mass casualty and/or major damages to property, disruption of means of livelihoods, roads and normal way of life of people in the affected areas as a result of the occurrence of natural or human-induced hazard.”
The Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) has issued a warning to the public to avoid consuming fish caught in areas impacted by the oil spill in Bataan province, as these fish are deemed unsafe for human consumption.
“[T]he Bureau maintains that as a precautionary measure, fish harvested from areas where oil slicks are observed be deemed unsafe for human consumption. This is to avoid incidents of food poisoning as a result of ingesting contaminated seafood,” BFAR said in a bulletin.
BFAR stated that it is carrying out continuous fish sample tests in the affected areas of Central Luzon, Calabarzon (Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal, and Quezon), and the National Capital Region (NCR) to determine if fish and other seafood are contaminated.
Results from a sensory evaluation showed fish samples collected from the towns of Noveleta and Rosario in Cavite province have “some degree of tainting with petrochemicals, albeit before any oil slicks were noticed in the area.”
Fish samples gathered from Cavite City as well as the towns of Tanza and Naic remain free from petrochemical contamination.

A no-catch and no-sell zone for all shellfish has also been issued in the province of Cavite.
In addition to the BFAR’s warning, the Department of Health (DOH) emphasized the immediate health risks associated with consuming contaminated water or seafood, including symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, coughing, irritability, and unconsciousness.
The DOH also warned that ingesting large quantities of contaminated water or seafood could lead to more severe outcomes, such as convulsions, coma, or even death.
Oil spills pose a significant threat to public health, not only through ingestion but also via other forms of exposure. The immediate symptoms associated with these exposures include:
Individuals experiencing any of these symptoms due to exposure to the oil spill are urged to seek immediate medical attention at the nearest health facility or consult a health care professional.
The DOH has issued comprehensive guidelines for residents living in or near areas impacted by the oil spill, detailing both recommended actions and essential precautions.
According to the DOH, the following measures should be observed:
The DOH also provided specific instructions for responders, volunteers, and cleanup workers, highlighting the importance of the following:

Additionally, the health department asked the public to avoid the following:
“While oil spills are rare, they can cause extensive damage to marine life and pose significant health risks to those exposed,” the DOH warned.
BFAR has estimated that the oil spill will devastate the livelihood of tens of thousands of fishers in Bataan, Bulacan, Pampanga, and Cavite, with projected monthly revenue losses of up to P83.8 million in Bataan alone and more than P70 million in Bulacan and Pampanga.

Data from the Department of Agriculture (DA) further detailed that 28,373 fishers and 5,810 boats have been hit with an estimated forgone income of P78.69 million over eight days since the fishing ban was imposed on July 30, 2024.

GRAPHIC: Ed Lustan / INQUIRER.net
The Pambansang Lakas ng Kilusang Mamamalakaya ng Pilipinas (Pamalakaya), a progressive fisherfolk organization, criticized the “indefinite fishing ban” imposed on nine coastal towns in Cavite, arguing that the ban is more harmful to fishers’ livelihood than the oil spill itself.
READ: Bataan fishers still waiting for assistance
“The government’s response to the oil spill has done more harm to the fishers’ livelihoods than the spill itself. While Cavite is under a fishing ban, the fishers are not receiving any regular support,” Ronnel Arambulo, vice chairperson of Pamalakaya, said in Filipino.
“We are calling for the lifting of the fishing ban because the oil is no longer directly affecting the fishing grounds of the province,” Arambulo added.
“Toxic oil spills in our oceans are like fires in our forests, leaving a path of destruction that brings decades of negative impacts,” Gloria Estenzo Ramos, Oceana’s vice president in the Philippines, said in a statement.
Ramos added that oil spills are “a deathtrap for marine ecosystems” and have detrimental effects on people, wildlife, and the environment.
She warned that if more than one million liters of oil onboard one of the sunken vessels is not safely removed, the resulting spill could have devastating effects, potentially killing marine wildlife, destroying mangroves, and endangering people’s health, food supply, and livelihood.

“We know what’s at stake here: jobs, food, exports, and even lives. Even after the oil pollution is cleaned up, seafood may be contaminated for years,” she said.
Ramos also underscored the long-term impact on the country, stating: “[t]he people of the Philippines will be dealing with the impacts of this devastation long after the headlines fade, and the government must do everything it can to mitigate this disaster as quickly as possible.”

MANILA, Philippines—With a coastline stretching over 18,000 kilometers and coastal waters covering 266,000 kilometers, the Philippines has seen some devastating oil spills in previous years.
Last week, a tanker carrying 800,000 liters of industrial fuel capsized at Balingawan Point in Tablas Strait near Naujan and the island province of Marinduque after it experienced engine trouble.
On February 28, MT Princess Empress, bound for Iloilo from Bataan, began to sink after its engine overheated due to straining amid rough sea conditions.
The following day, the tanker plunged 460 meters below sea level.
According to the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG), the oil spill has already reached the island town of Caluya, between Mindoro and Panay. It has also been observed along the shoreline of Barangay Buhay na Tubig in Pola town.
Officials from several coastal towns of Oriental Mindoro have already declared states of calamity.
As government agencies and experts assess the extent of the damage caused by the oil spill from MV Princess Empress, INQUIRER.net looks back at some of the biggest oil spills in the country.
In the past years, similar spills—some even more significant and devastating—have threatened other parts of the country.
On August 11, 2006, strong winds and high waves battered the oil tanker MT Solar I off the southern coast of Guimaras while it was carrying 2 million liters of bunker fuel from Petron Corp. The tanker was on its way to Zamboanga City from Bataan when it was overcome by unusually rough waves.

Known as the worst oil spill in the country’s history, the spill affected 1,500 hectares of the local ecosystem—including mangroves, seagrass, and coral reefs—and has severely affected the province’s marine resources, tourism industry, and economy.
According to The Manila Bay Oil Spill Contingency Plan, the largest oil spill that occurred in Manila Bay took place in Mariveles, Bulacan on July 1999, when MT Mary Anne spilled a total volume of 747,991 liters of oil.
A year before, in September 1998, MV Princess of the Orient was carrying around 600,000 liters of bunker oil and 11,000 liters of lubricating oil when it sank off Batangas and caused a massive oil spill in Manila Bay.
In August 2013, an aerial survey conducted by the PCG discovered that an estimated 500,000 liters of diesel spilled into the waters off Cavite, affecting at least four towns in the province (Rosario, Naic, Tanza, and Ternate).
Initial investigations pointed at the oil tanker MT Makisig as the source of the leak. Due to the damage caused by the spill, environmental advocates described the incident as “a repeat performance” of the “worst maritime oil disaster in the Philippines.”
Another massive oil spill hit Manila Bay in March 1999 when the tanker MT Sea Brothers sank in the bay while carrying 420,000 liters of bunker oil.
In December 2005, an oil barge of the National Power Corp. capsized off the shore of Semirara in Antique, spilling almost 200,000 liters of oil and contaminating about 40 square kilometers of water off Semirara.
Based on Greenpeace’s oil spill damage assessment, the oil spill affected over 100 hectares of mangrove and beach area and the island. The livelihood of at least 21 families likewise took a hit due to the spill.
Oil spills in Manila Bay, a key economic gateway where the majority of the country’s economic activities take place, are more common than some might think.
The Global Environment Facility (GEF)—United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)—International Maritime Organization Regional Programme on Building Partnerships in Environmental Management for the Seas of East Asia (PEMSEA) found that, on average, around 30,000 vessels enter Manila Bay each year.
“A majority of these vessels, which include tankers, passenger and cargo ships, either utilizes oil as fuel or carries it as their cargo. Ship-sourced pollution may result from either accidental or illegal operational discharge of these vessels,” the GEF-UNDP-PEMSEA explained.
GRAPHIC Ed Lustan
Oil spills could also occur during the process of loading and unloading petroleum products in the oil refineries within the bay. The depots found in Manila Bay’s shoreline include:
“Aside from these depots that dot the Manila Bay coast, a large depot could also be found in Pandacan, Manila. Even though the depot is located inside the Pasig River and is kilometers away from the bay itself, the amount of petroleum stored in its tank farms could pose a significant threat to Manila Bay,” said GEF-UNDP-PEMSEA.
Historical data showed a total of 18 oil spills within Manila Bay from February 1998 to December 2004. Nine took place in the province of Bataan, in the ports of Limay and Mariveles, with a total volume of 789,751 liters.
Data also showed that most oil spills in Manila Bay occur where vessel traffic is heavy.
Among the crucial parts of oil spill risk assessment involves identifying risk factors that may cause them.
According to The Manila Bay Oil Spill Contingency Plan, the risk factors identified in Manila Bay waters based on previously recorded spills include:
Aside from listing the risk-causing factors, the assessment also listed other factors that may heighten the risk of oil spills.
GRAPHIC Ed Lustan
Some of the most common factors that impact the risk of oil spills from occurring are various shipping-related risks like:
Environmental factors—including tidal flow, weather, current, wind temperature, sea state, and type of shoreline—could also increase the possibility of oil spills.
Other factors like future trends, the presence of oil terminals and depots, and the capacity and capability of the response team could also escalate the chances and dangers of oil spills, according to GEF-UNDP-PEMSEA.
GRAPHIC Ed Lustan
In terms of sources of oil spills, records from the PCG secured by the National Operation Center for Oil Pollution (NOCOP) found that vessels are the top sources of major spills in the country.
From 1975 to 2019, a total of 305 major oil spills involved domestic, local, and foreign vessels that were usually engaged in domestic or international trading.
“Vessels are sources of oil spill when they are involved in collision…grounding and the likes,” NOSCOP stated.
Power plants and power barges; shipyards; refineries, terminals and depots; oil exploration and production activities; offshore mining activities; and industrial and manufacturing activities are also listed as sources of oil spills.
In some cases, however, NOSCOP noted that “mystery” spills occur where the spiller or source of the spillage and leak is unknown.

Authorities are rushing efforts to prevent a repeat of last year’s disastrous oil spill off Mindoro Island after a local oil tanker carrying 1.4 million liters of industrial fuel sank about 7 kilometers east of Limay town in Bataan province early Thursday, according to the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG).
Rear Adm. Armand Balilo, the PCG spokesperson, said MT Terra Nova capsized and sank at 1:10 a.m. on Thursday in rough waters close to the mouth of Manila Bay while the oil tanker was on its way to Iloilo province.
READ: Oil spill from sunken tanker off Bataan may reach Manila shores – PCG
He warned that if all the ship’s cargo leaked, it would become the worst oil spill in the country’s history.
“We are racing against time and we will try to do our best to contain it immediately and stop the fuel from leaking,” he said.
“There is a big danger that Manila will be affected, even the shoreline of Manila if the fuel [leaks] because it is within Manila Bay,” he added.
Balilo said 16 of the 17 crew on board have been rescued. The body of a missing crew member was found on Thursday afternoon off Limay.
The ship is 34 meters underwater, which is “considerably shallow,” he said.
Balilo said the surviving crew told the PCG that their ship left Bataan on Wednesday night and was hit by big waves as they were about to sail away from the waters of Corregidor.
“At about 10 p.m., they felt that the waves were strong and the captain decided to return,” he said. “But immediately, they had a hard time returning because they were met by strong waves and the term that the crew used was ‘sumalok sila ng alon’ (scooped up waves) until the ship was filled with water and they completely capsized.”
Manila and nearby provinces, including Bataan, then were experiencing torrential rains and winds from Supertyphoon “Carina” (international name: Gaemi).
In a statement on Thursday night, MT Terra Nova’s ship manager, Portavaga Ship Management, identified the dead crew member as Second Mate Alvin Llandelar. He was 40 and married.
An aerial inspection on Thursday showed an oil spill about 3.7 km long east of Lamao Point in Limay and moving east to northeast carried by strong currents, according to Balilo.
What was leaking, for now, was the “working fuel” used by the ship’s engines, he said.
“So far, the oil spill is minimal,” according to Balilo.
He said marine environmental protection personnel had been mobilized to deal with the spill.
PCG Commandant Adm. Ronnie Gil Gavan has ordered deploying three 44-meter multi-role response vessels to augment ongoing oil spill response operations in Bataan.
“These vessels will start the application of oil dispersants to immediately mitigate the impact, especially during the period where siphoning is being prepared,” Gavan said.
He said the PCG was targeting to finish siphoning the industrial fuel from the 22-year-old tanker in seven days.
Siphoning would “not be very technical” and could be done quickly to protect the waters of Bataan and Manila Bay “against environmental, social, economic, financial and political impacts,” said Balilo.
In February last year, a tanker carrying 800,000 liters of industrial fuel sank below 369 meters about 14 km northeast of Balisangan Point, Pola, Oriental Mindoro.
Almost four months later, most of the cargo of the MR Princess Empress had either leaked away or been siphoned off.
The Mindoro oil spill reached as far as Palawan and Batangas provinces.
President Marcos ordered the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) to undertake measures to mitigate the environmental damage that might result from an oil spill from the Terra Nova.
The President said the DENR can work with the Department of Science and Technology in making immediate meteorological assessments, referring to the location of the vessel, and the speed and direction of the winds and currents.
“Hopefully, we can catch it (the oil spill) before [it makes] landfall. But with the seas being so rough, it will be a bit more difficult,” he said.
He said the authorities would have to determine which coastal areas the oil spill was headed to “so that we can try and prepare for that.”
In Bataan, Limay Vice Mayor Richie David said a salvage operation would be started once the weather conditions improved.
He cautioned residents against fishing because oil spills could occur during the operation.
Bataan Gov. Joet Garcia assured residents that the local government was working to prevent an oil spill.
Jochele Magracia, a resident of Limay’s Barangay Lamao and chair of Young Bataeños for Environment Advocacy Network (YoungBEAN), said they were worried about the livelihood of their community.
In Lamao alone, hundreds of fishermen would be affected by an oil spill. These numbers do not include others in the province who also rely on the sea for their livelihood.
“The impact of the typhoon continues on our community. For several days, the fishermen couldn’t venture to fish because of the strong waves caused by the typhoon, and the houses here were also flooded and it became even more painful because we heard that there was an oil spill here,” said Magracia.
Environmentalist Derek Cabe said what happened was an “additional disaster waiting to devastate the marine resources and the very source of food and livelihood of the community.”
“This is the reason why we should demand accountability from the corporations and the authorities that allowed the ship to sail despite the typhoon,” said Cabe, who is a coordinator of the Nuclear/Coal-Free Bataan Movement.

Despite the safety assurance, Degala said there has been a noticeable decline in the demand and consumption of fish and seafood, likely due to public concern following news of the oil spill.
On Aug. 8, around 30 personnel from Benro, the Provincial Disaster Risk Reduction Management Office (PDRRMO), the Provincial Agriculture Office, and market masters inspected the fish stalls at the public markets in the towns of Hagonoy, Paombong, Bulakan, and Obando and Malolos City.
These agencies are part of the Bulacan Incident Management Team created by Gov. Daniel Fernando to monitor if the oil spill would affect the province.
“Based on the technical team’s findings, there is a general concern among the public about consuming fish and seafood, despite no confirmed reports of the oil spill affecting the province,” Degala noted in an interagency meeting at Hiyas Pavilion in this city on Aug. 9.

Wilfredo Cruz, Central Luzon director of the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources, also led a sensory evaluation on Aug. 1 and confirmed no traces of oil were found in fish and seafood sold in Bulacan. To demonstrate the safety of Bulacan’s seafood, Cruz and local officials took part in a boodle fight featuring “bangus” on the same day.
The Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) initially projected the oil spill would move southwards and affect coastal areas along Manila Bay in the provinces of Pampanga, Bulacan and Cavite and Malabon City in the National Capital Region.
Seafood sold in the towns of Hagonoy, Paombong, Bulakan, Obando and Malolos City—areas initially thought to be in the path of the spill—were typically sourced from Malabon, Hagonoy, Malolos City and Pampanga.
As of last week, however, the impact of the spill from Terranova, which was carrying 1.4 million liters of industrial fuel when it sank off Limay town in Bataan, was not as widespread as feared. So far, only Cavite’s coastal areas suffered from its impact.
Lt. Commander Michael Encina, the PCG’s spokesperson, reported during a National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council emergency meeting on July 29 that the oil leak from Terranova had significantly decreased, with the amount of spilled oil expected to dissipate naturally.
But the demand for fish in Bulacan continued to decline, forcing vendors to reduce their prices, Degala said.
He said they recommended an information drive to “reassure the public that Bulacan’s seafood is free from oil contamination.”
PDRRMO chief Manuel Lukban Jr. added that some retailers agreed that local suppliers should work to dispel misinformation about the oil spill.
Mar Trillana, a fishpond operator in Hagonoy, reported that daily sales of cultured bangus (milkfish) and tilapia raised in local fishponds and not in Manila Bay saw a 65-percent drop, from 50 tons to just 15 tons.
Fish vendor Jocelyn Lomotan, 61, lamented the “sluggish” sale at her stall at the Malolos City public market for the last three weeks, while Norma David, a fish dealer in Malabon, said her regular customers stopped coming to her stall in Sta. Maria town following the news of the oil spill.

But while others have reduced their prices, vendor Eleonor Garcia of Bulakan town said they maintained regular prices of bangus at P150-P180 per kilo and “galunggong” at P200 per kilo because “if prices are lowered, people might think the oil spill is real.”

MANILA, Philippines – Cavite Gov. Jonvic Remulla alerted coastal communities on Monday following reports that oil leaking from tanker Terra Nova, which sank off Bataan on July 25, had reached parts of the province, particularly Ternate, Maragondon, Naic and Tanza.
“It (the oil spill) was felt slightly early this morning. [We’re on our way] to [assist the affected villagers],” Remulla said.
According to fisherfolk group Pamalakaya, coastal residents of Tanza woke up to the “distinctive odor associated with the oil spill” on Sunday morning.

“Our worst fear has happened; the oil has spread throughout the vast Manila Bay and has disrupted the livelihood of many fishermen,” Pamalakaya vice chair Ronnel Arambulo said in a statement.
Fishermen were worried that the oil slick might contaminate fishery resources and affect the farm-gate prices of their catch, he added.
The group estimated that in Tanza alone, over 5,000 fisherfolk would be affected if the spill could not be immediately contained.
The Philippine Coast Guard (PCG), for its part, said that divers had sealed most of the sunken tanker’s leaking valves and were capping off even those that remained intact before siphoning operations could begin.
“We are hoping to seal all 24 valves today (July 29). We’re conducting the final mobilization of the siphoning equipment,” PCG Bataan Station commander Lt. Cmdr. Michael John Encina said in a press briefing. As of Monday afternoon, there were monitored leaks at one liter per hour, which he considered as “minimal.”
Terra Nova was carrying 1.4 million liters of industrial fuel oil when it sank amid stormy weather off Bataan on July 25, killing a crew member.
Around 300,000 liters of oil would be siphoned from the tanker and transferred to MT Helena Marie, the ship’s sister vessel.
“The moment that we lift the vessel and bring it adjacent to the shore, we can say it’s all under control,” Encina said.
The PCG earlier warned of an “environmental catastrophe” if the entire cargo leaked.
According to Encina, the siphoning operation will take five to seven days, 10 days being the longest. An estimated 50,000 liters per day will be taken out of the tanker.
The oil sheen monitored where the vessel sank has been reduced to 2 to 4 nautical miles from the stretch of 12 to 14 kilometers, he said.
At the same time, he said they were still verifying reports that the oil spill had reached the coastlines of Cavite and Bataan.
Environmental group Greenpeace earlier released photos and videos showing that an oil sheen had reached Hagonoy, Bulacan.
Meanwhile, all leaks found on another sunken motor tanker, Jason Bradley, have been sealed.
“The tanker carried 5.5 tons of diesel cargo, which had already been emptied. The mere fact that it’s diesel means it is easy to dissipate,” Encina said.
But the PCG is preparing charges against the owner of the tanker for not reporting the incident immediately when it sank on July 23 due to bad weather, two days before Terra Nova capsized. The six crew members onboard the Jason Bradley were rescued by another vessel, he added.

MANILA, Philippines — Cavite Gov. Jonvic Remulla has assured the province’s residents affected by the oil spill from fuel tanker MT Terranova that sank off Bataan that they will receive proper compensation, its amount estimated to reach more than P12 million.
“They (MT Terranova management) assured us that 31,000 fisherfolk will be compensated in due time after the validation of the damage,” Remulla told reporters after he met with Terranova’s representatives at the governor’s office on Tuesday morning.

The provincial government was following the standard procedure for filing the insurance claims,” Remulla explained in the video of the interview that was posted on social media by Cavite-based journalists.
When asked how much the estimated cost was, Remulla replied: “P12 million for the last 12 days and running.”
The governor said they were estimating a compensation of P350 a day multiplied by the number of days that the fisherfolk, market vendors and shellfish cage caretakers will be displaced.
“We are well documented on who was affected in Cavite,” he added.
In a separate brief radio interview, Remulla emphasized what transpired during the meeting.
“Wala kaming aregluhan, wala kaming usapan. Kung merong pananagutang kriminal sa nangyari sa Terranova ay mananagot sila (There was no settlement, we didn’t talk about that. If there is criminal liability in what happened with Terranova, they will be held accountable),” he said.
MT Terranova, owned by Shogun Ships Co. Inc. sank in the waters off Limay town in Bataan on July 25, with 1.4 million liters of industrial fuel on board, during the onslaught of Supertyphoon Carina (international name: Gaemi).
The vessel was chartered to carry the fuel from Limay to Iloilo City by SL Harbor Bulk Terminal Corp., a subsidiary of San Miguel Corp., the largest conglomerate in the country.
The Philippine Coast Guard has reported that the oil that leaked from the tanker has spread across the waters off provinces surrounding Manila Bay, including Cavite, adding that it has been working round the clock to contain the spill.
However, during the media interview, Remulla reported that the oil sheen in the coastal areas of Cavite has started to disappear.
On Saturday, Remulla announced they would file criminal charges against the Terranova owner for the affected residents to claim damages for what happened to the coastal areas in Cavite.
Remulla on Tuesday explained that the filing of cases would depend on the findings of the Department of Justice.
He said they have yet to file the complaints.
“Because the process has just begun. But we are cooperating, and we are in touch,” Remulla said.
Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla recently announced that a class suit was being eyed against those responsible for the three recent maritime mishaps in Bataan.
He said the authorities were looking into the angle of the criminal cases against the owners, and others who may be responsible for maritime tragedies.
After the sinking of Terranova, another tanker, the MTKR Jason Bradley, also capsized due to bad weather in the waters off Bataan on July 27.
Four days later, another vessel, the MV Mirola 1, which was carrying diesel oil, ran aground in shallow waters off the coast of Bataan’s Mariveles town, causing the ship to tip over.
The Cavite provincial government on Wednesday declared a state of calamity in the cities of Cavite and Bacoor, and the towns of Noveleta, Rosario, Kawit, Tanza, Naic, Maragondon and Ternate affected by Terranova’s oil spill.

MANILA, Philippines – The Senate inquiry on the massive oil spill caused by the ill-fated MT Terranova will push through on Aug. 13, Senate Majority Leader Francis Tolentino announced on Wednesday.
Tolentino earlier filed a resolution to investigate the cause of the oil spill that affected around 46,000 fisherfolk, marine biodiversity, and food security in Bataan, Cavite, Metro Manila, and nearby areas.
“We need to set up stricter mechanisms to prevent such incidents, and to improve our capability to immediately respond to contain, clean up, and mitigate the impact of this toxic substance on the fishing sector and the environment,” Tolentino said in a news release, citing similar occurrences in Pola, Oriental Mindoro in 2023, and the island-province of Guimaras in 2006.
Tolentino also urged the Department of Agriculture (DA) to collaborate with other agencies to support fish vendors who are affected by the lower catch and subsequent fishing bans due to the oil spill.

“We must not forget the fish vendors. The government must also reach out to them because we have interviewed sellers in public markets who said that many stalls selling fish have now been closed,” the senator told DA Assistant Secretary Arnel De Mesa in his radio program.
In response, De Mesa assured the DA will work with the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) and the Department of Trade Industry (DTI) to assist fish vendors.
The Philippine Coast Guard is currently receiving assistance from the United States Coast Guard and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to contain the spill.
The DA, through the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR), has also started extending fuel subsidies to affected fisherfolk.

CITY OF SAN FERNANDO — The Pampanga provincial government has laid out 780 meters of floating booms made out of coconut waste products and plastic bottles to stop the seepage of fuel oil that has spilled from a motor tanker that sank about 30 kilometers from Limay in Bataan on July 24.
At least 57 booms at a length of 342 meters were placed at the mouth of the Batang Dos River, an official of the Pampanga Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (PDRRMC) said in a report.
Twenty more booms spanning 120 meters on the Baruya River, 32 booms extending 192 meters on Bancal Pugad, and 21 booms covering 126 meters on the Mabuanbuan River had been secured on bamboo stacks, according to PDRRMC officer Angelina Blanco.
Using coconut husks donated by Batangas and Quezon provinces and shredded hair, Pampanga has produced 1,822 booms as of Aug. 12, according to Art Punsalan, head of the provincial government environment and natural resources offices.
Blanco did not cite laboratory results of water and air samples. Still, an Inquirer source who showed an Environmental Management Bureau’s Aug. 12 report said six stations recorded “within standard” findings.
The PDRRMC, chaired by Gov. Dennis Pineda, projected the directly affected fisherfolk at 21,621 in 93 villages in the coastal towns of Guagua, Lubao, Macabebe, Masantol, Minalin, and Sasmuan.
Pineda said they are fishermen, fishpond operators or owners, workers, vendors, and boatmen.  On Tuesday, a big fishpond owner in Minalin was in a wait-and-see mode rather than opting for an early harvest.
“The oil slick has not reached Pampanga waters yet, and the dikes are protecting the [inland] ponds. Many of us have managed the volume of tilapia we sell to buyers who pick up their daily supplies. So far, business is still safe, said the trader. INQ

LUCENA CITY, QUEZON, Philippines — The provincial government of Cavite and other agencies have begun providing assistance to fisherfolk affected by the oil spill from a tanker that sank on July 25 in the waters off Bataan.
On Saturday, the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) of the Department of Agriculture distributed food packs to 1,612 fishermen in Noveleta town who had been registered for government assistance.
“Today’s distribution is just the beginning of our comprehensive relief and recovery plan for the affected fisherfolk of Cavite,” BFAR officer-in-charge Isidro Velayo Jr. was quoted as saying in a social media post by the agency’s Calabarzon office.

“We are committed to providing continuous support and working closely with local communities to restore their livelihoods and ensure sustainable recovery,” he added.
Velayo also said livelihood restoration initiatives and environmental rehabilitation efforts, were being planned and would be carried out in the coming weeks.
The Cavite government said it began providing food packages on Thursday, with 2,196 beneficiaries in Cavite City receiving the aid that day and another 2,867 on Friday.
Affected residents in the municipalities of Kawit and Rosario town also received food assistance.
MT Terranova, which was carrying 1.4 million liters of industrial fuel, sank off the waters of Limay town in Bataan on July 25, during the onslaught of Supertyphoon “Carina” (international name: Gaemi)
The Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) reported that the oil from the tanker spread across the waters of other provinces surrounding Manila Bay, including Cavite.
On Wednesday, the provincial government declared a state of calamity in two cities and nine towns—Cavite City and Bacoor City, and the municipalities of Noveleta, Rosario, Kawit, Tanza, Naic, Maragondon and Ternate.
A declaration of a state of calamity allows the concerned local governments to quickly access emergency funds and implement relief operations for affected residents.
To protect the health and safety of the public, Cavite Gov. Jonvic Remulla prohibited the catching and selling of all marine products to prevent oil contamination.
According to the Calabarzon Regional Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (RDRRMC), an estimated 352,179 residents in the coastal barangays of Cavite were affected by the oil spill.
Some “25,145 fisherfolks were also affected with an estimated loss of income amounting to P17,952,775 per day and predictably in 22 days, a total of P394,961,064,” the RDRRMC said in a report.
The Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) on Saturday said it would pursue a full probe on the July 25 sinking of the Terranova and of the MT Jason Bradley two days later also in Bataan.
“But for now, we are focused on our mission, which is to prevent [the further spread of the] oil spill,” Interior Secretary Benhur Abalos said at a press conference on Saturday.
He said the DILG is coordinating with the PCG in containing the oil spill, after it had confirmed that oil continues to leak from the Terranova at a rate of 1 liter per hour.

MANILA, Philippines — Authorities are moving to contain the ensuing oil spill from the submerged Motor Tanker (MT) Terra Nova at the portion of Manila Bay off Limay municipality in Bataan province.
Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) spokesperson Rear Admiral Armand Balilo said Thursday that if all 1.4 million liters of fuel the vessel was carrying would seep into the sea, the oil spill may reach the shores of the country’s capital, Manila, and be the worst oil spill in the country’s history.
Currently, Balilo said that only the “working fuel” of the ship or the fuel being used by the vessel to run has leaked. He added that the working fuel spill was only “minimal.”

MT Terra Nova was en route to Iloilo to deliver the fuel when it “capsized and eventually submerged” east of Lamao Point in Limay municipality at around 1:10 a.m. on Thursday.
“Of course, there is a big danger that Manila would be affected, even the shorelines of Manila because it is within Manila Bay,” Balilo said in an online briefing when asked what would happen if all 1.4 million liters of fuel [spilled] into the sea. He noted that their contingency plan includes such a worst-case situation.
“So far, the oil spill is minimal; probably, it’s the fuel used by the ship,” Balilo also said.“I have no details as to how much is the working fuel, but it’s very minimal.”
Balilo said the PCG’s marine environmental protection personnel have also been mobilized to prevent an oil slick.

The PCG dispatched personnel to Navotas, Bulacan, and Pampanga “to monitor and prepare for a possible oil spill,” following the sinking of the Philippine-flagged MT Terra Nova. Meanwhile, its BRP Melchora Aquino has been deployed to conduct search and rescue operations.
Balilo said 16 of the 17 crew on board had been rescued and PCG personnel aboard the vessel continued to look for the missing crew member.
The biggest oil spill in the country’s history thus far happened on February 28, 2023, when MT Princess Empress, carrying 800,000 liters of industrial fuel, sank off Naujan, Oriental Mindoro.
The clearing of oil slicks, which reached as far as Palawan and Verde Island Passage shores in Batangas, took a few months. Thousands of fishermen also lost their livelihood due to the incident.
The Office of Civil Defense said before that the government shelled out almost P1 billion to respond to the Mindoro oil spill.
Balilo said that if all 1.4 liters of industrial fuel carried by MT Terra Nova leaked, it would beat the Oriental Mindoro incident and become the worst oil spill in the country’s history.
